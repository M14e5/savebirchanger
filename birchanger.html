        <h3>Village Under Threat: Development Would Double Our Population</h3>
        <p>City & Country's proposal threatens to transform Birchanger from a close-knit village of 1,000 residents into an urban extension. This isn't growth - it's the destruction of our village character. <strong>Act now before it's too late!</strong></p>

            <h2>Why Birchanger Must Be Protected</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Birchanger isn't just another village - it's a living piece of Essex history with a unique rural character that has survived for over 1,000 years. Our name, meaning 'wooded slope with birch trees', reflects our deep connection to the landscape.</p>

                    <h3>12th Century Heritage</h3>
                    <p>St Mary's Church has stood at the heart of our village since the 1100s, with Anglo-Saxon origins dating back even further. This sacred site and its peaceful churchyard represent nearly a millennium of continuous worship and community life.</p>

                    <h3>Ancient Woodland</h3>
                    <p>Birchanger Wood's 69 acres of ancient woodland is one of Essex's natural treasures, home to rare species and the birch trees that gave our village its name. This irreplaceable habitat has existed since before the Norman Conquest.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">This development isn't about meeting local housing needs - it's about profit at the expense of our community. Here's what we face:</p>

            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li><strong>Complete Loss of Village Identity:</strong> Birchanger would become a suburb, indistinguishable from the urban sprawl stretching from Bishop's Stortford to Stansted.</li>
                <li><strong>Destruction of Rural Setting:</strong> The fields and hedgerows that have defined our village boundaries for centuries would be concreted over.</li>
                <li><strong>Overwhelmed Village Infrastructure:</strong> Our single village shop, primary school, and narrow lanes cannot cope with doubling the population.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Dark Skies:</strong> Street lighting from thousands of new homes would end our rural nights and harm nocturnal wildlife.</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Gridlock:</strong> Birchanger Lane and our village roads would become rat-runs for commuters avoiding the M11 and A120.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Dilution:</strong> The close-knit nature of village life, where everyone contributes and belongs, would be impossible to maintain.</li>
