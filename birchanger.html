They claim this land is "grey belt" under NPPF Paragraph 155 and meets the "Golden Rules" - but this land STRONGLY serves Green Belt purposes protecting our village setting. <strong>When the application drops, we have just 21 days to object.

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Why Birchanger Must Be Protected</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Birchanger isn't just another village - it's a living piece of Essex history with a unique rural character that has survived for over 1,000 years. Our name, meaning 'wooded slope with birch trees', reflects our deep connection to the landscape.</p>

            <div class="grid">

                    <div class="card-icon">⛪</div>
                    <h3>12th Century Heritage</h3>
                    <p>St Mary's Church has stood at the heart of our village since the 1100s, with Anglo-Saxon origins dating back even further. This sacred site and its peaceful churchyard represent nearly a millennium of continuous worship and community life.</p>

                    <h3>Ancient Woodland</h3>
                    <p>Birchanger Wood's 69 acres of ancient woodland is one of Essex's natural treasures, home to rare species and the birch trees that gave our village its name. This irreplaceable habitat has existed since before the Norman Conquest.</p>

                    <h3>True Village Community</h3>
                    <p>With just 1,000 residents, everyone knows their neighbours. Our village hall hosts everything from parish meetings to children's parties. The Three Willows pub is where generations have gathered. This is real community - not just houses.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 2rem 0;">City & Country claims this meets the "Golden Rules" for development and qualifies as "grey belt" under NPPF Paragraph 155. But the reality for Birchanger villagers tells a different story:</p>

            <ul class="impact-list">
                <li><strong>NPPF Para 155 Test FAILS - Land Strongly Serves Green Belt:</strong> This land prevents coalescence between Birchanger and Stansted, safeguards our village's countryside setting, and protects St Mary's Church from urban encroachment. NPPF Para 155 requires land to NOT strongly serve Green Belt purposes - this test fails immediately for Birchanger.</li>
                <li><strong>"Grey Belt" Strategy Fails Sustainability Test:</strong> Site is 2.1km from Stansted station with NO continuous footway (fails DfT 800m walkability standard). Bus route 308 runs hourly Mon-Sat only, last bus 6:30pm, NO Sunday service. This is car-dependent development, NOT sustainable location required by NPPF Para 155.</li>
                <li><strong>"Golden Rules" Unenforceable Without Section 106:</strong> Developer promises 50% affordable housing, school expansion land, >20% biodiversity net gain, net zero carbon - but where are the legally binding Section 106 agreements ensuring delivery BEFORE occupation? Land for school expansion is meaningless without funded buildings, teachers, equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Loss of Village Identity:</strong> 180 homes would add 445 residents to a village of ~1,000 - a 44% population increase. Birchanger would become a suburb, indistinguishable from the urban sprawl stretching from Bishop's Stortford to Stansted.</li>
                <li><strong>Destruction of Historic Rural Setting:</strong> The fields surrounding St Mary's Church (12th century) and Birchanger Wood (ancient woodland) have defined our village boundaries for centuries. This setting STRONGLY serves Green Belt purposes protecting our heritage.</li>
                <li><strong>Construction Access Nightmare:</strong> Years of construction lorries, heavy plant machinery, and delivery vehicles would thunder through our narrow village lanes (designed for 1,000 residents, not construction traffic for 180 homes). No construction traffic management plan is legally secured via Section 106.</li>
                <li><strong>Overwhelmed Village Infrastructure:</strong> Our primary school, Village Hall, and narrow lanes cannot cope with 445 more residents. Where's the committed Section 106 funding for infrastructure expansion?</li>
                <li><strong>Traffic Gridlock:</strong> 442 daily car trips added to Birchanger Lane and village roads would turn them into rat-runs for commuters avoiding the M11 and A120. No highway capacity upgrades are funded or legally secured.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Dilution:</strong> The close-knit nature of village life, where everyone knows their neighbours and contributes to community events, would be impossible to maintain with 44% population growth.</li>
            </ul>

How tearing out green land and trees for more concrete going to help the natural flow of water. The impact of more houses is just unthinkable."</p>
