# AI Template Generator - Setup Guide

This guide will help you deploy the AI template generator feature securely using Cloudflare Workers.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Steps

### 1. Revoke the Exposed API Key **IMMEDIATELY**

The OpenAI API key you shared has been exposed and **must be revoked now**:

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Find the key starting with `sk-proj-R7OU...`
3. Click the **Revoke** button
4. Confirm revocation

**Do this before anything else!**

### 2. Create a New API Key

After revoking the old key:

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Click **"+ Create new secret key"**
3. Name it something like "Save Birchanger Templates"
4. Copy the new key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)
5. **Store it securely** - you'll need it for deployment

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v16 or later)
- A [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) (free tier is fine)
- Your new OpenAI API key from step 2 above

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install Wrangler (Cloudflare CLI)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

Verify installation:

```bash
wrangler --version
```

### Step 2: Login to Cloudflare

```bash
wrangler login
```

This will open your browser to authenticate with Cloudflare.

### Step 3: Configure Your Account ID

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Copy your **Account ID** (shown in the sidebar or URL)
3. Edit `wrangler.toml` and uncomment the account_id line:

```toml
account_id = "your-account-id-here"
```

### Step 4: Set Your OpenAI API Key Securely

**IMPORTANT:** Never put your API key directly in code or configuration files!

Run this command to store it securely:

```bash
cd /home/mike/fixrepo/savebirchanger
wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

When prompted, paste your **new** OpenAI API key and press Enter.

### Step 5: Deploy the Worker

From your project directory:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

You should see output like:

```
Total Upload: XX.XX KiB / gzip: XX.XX KiB
Uploaded template-generator (X.XX sec)
Published template-generator (X.XX sec)
  https://template-generator.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

**Copy this URL** - you'll need it in the next step!

### Step 6: Update the HTML File

1. Open `templates.html`
2. Find this line (around line 1199):

```javascript
const WORKER_API_URL = 'https://template-generator.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev';
```

3. Replace it with your actual Worker URL from Step 5:

```javascript
const WORKER_API_URL = 'https://template-generator.YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev';
```

### Step 7: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

Now that the worker is set up, deploy your updated `templates.html`:

1. Commit your changes:

```bash
git add templates.html
git commit -m "Add AI template generator feature"
git push origin main
```

2. Your site should auto-deploy via Cloudflare Pages (if already set up)
3. If not, manually upload via Cloudflare Pages dashboard

### Step 8: Test the Feature

1. Visit your templates page: `https://your-site.pages.dev/templates.html`
2. Enter the password to unlock the templates
3. Scroll to the top - you should see the "ðŸ¤– AI Template Generator" section
4. Select a template type
5. Answer the questions
6. Click "Generate My Template"
7. Verify you get a personalized response!

## Security Features Included

âœ… **API Key Protection**: Your OpenAI key is stored as an encrypted Cloudflare secret, never exposed to users

âœ… **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection limiting users to 10 requests per hour

âœ… **CORS Protection**: Can be restricted to your domain only (see customization below)

âœ… **Input Validation**: Prevents malicious or empty requests

## Optional: Restrict to Your Domain Only

For extra security, you can restrict the API to only work from your domain.

Edit `workers/template-generator.js` and change this line:

```javascript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
```

To:

```javascript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': 'https://your-actual-domain.pages.dev',
```

Then redeploy:

```bash
wrangler deploy
```

## Monitoring & Costs

### Check Worker Usage

View your worker's usage and logs:

```bash
wrangler tail
```

Or visit: https://dash.cloudflare.com/ â†’ Workers & Pages â†’ template-generator

### OpenAI Costs

Monitor your OpenAI usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage

**Estimated costs:**
- GPT-4o: ~$0.005 per template generation
- 100 generations = ~$0.50
- 1000 generations = ~$5.00

The built-in rate limiting helps control costs.

### Cloudflare Costs

Free tier includes:
- 100,000 requests per day
- More than enough for this use case!

## Troubleshooting

### "Worker not found" error

- Make sure you deployed: `wrangler deploy`
- Check the URL in `templates.html` matches your worker URL

### "Failed to generate template" error

- Verify your OpenAI API key is set: `wrangler secret list`
- Check you have credits on your OpenAI account
- View logs: `wrangler tail`

### Rate limit issues

If legitimate users are being rate-limited, you can adjust the limits in `workers/template-generator.js`:

```javascript
const RATE_LIMIT = {
  requests: 20,  // Increase from 10 to 20
  window: 3600000
};
```

Then redeploy: `wrangler deploy`

### CORS errors

If you see CORS errors in the browser console:

1. Check that `WORKER_API_URL` in templates.html is correct
2. Verify the worker is deployed: `wrangler deploy`
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

## Updating the Worker

To make changes to the worker:

1. Edit `workers/template-generator.js`
2. Test locally (optional): `wrangler dev`
3. Deploy: `wrangler deploy`

Changes are live immediately!

## Improving the AI Output

To adjust how the AI generates templates:

### Make it more/less formal

Edit the system prompt in `workers/template-generator.js` (around line 87):

```javascript
const systemPrompt = `You are helping a local resident write a ${templateInfo.name}...
- DO sound passionate but respectful and factual
- ADJUST THIS TO YOUR PREFERENCE
`;
```

### Adjust length

In the OpenAI API call (around line 172):

```javascript
max_tokens: 1000,  // Increase for longer responses
```

### Change creativity level

```javascript
temperature: 0.8,  // Lower (0.3-0.5) = more consistent, Higher (0.8-1.0) = more creative
```

After changes, redeploy: `wrangler deploy`
