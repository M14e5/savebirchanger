## Objection 1

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident of 24 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The site prevents coalescence between two distinct medieval settlements. It safeguards the setting of a nationally designated heritage asset. It maintains the strategic gap preventing M11 corridor sprawl. Strong Green Belt contribution.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to Stansted station is 2.1km on roads without footways, failing accessibility standards. The bus service (route 308) is hourly Mon-Sat only, no evening or Sunday service. This location fails NPPF Para 155 sustainability test.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing: no evidence 50% is economically viable. Infrastructure: school land offered but building costs unfunded. Highway upgrades are vague s106 "contributions". BNG off-site with no secured management plan. Nothing legally committed before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity crisis - Forest Hall is full, children being sent to schools miles away. GP surgery appointments take 2-3 weeks to get. Traffic on Cambridge Road is gridlocked morning and evening. Local flooding gets worse every year.

### Generated Objection Letter

```
I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having resided in this area for 24 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this site plays in maintaining the separation between our two distinct medieval settlements. The land is vital not only for preserving local heritage by safeguarding a nationally designated asset but also for preventing urban sprawl along the M11 corridor. This proposal significantly undermines these strong contributions to the Green Belt's function by disrupting both spatial and visual openness.

The location of the proposed development raises significant concerns regarding transport and accessibility. With Stansted station located 2.1km away on roads lacking footways, pedestrian access fails to meet necessary safety standards. Furthermore, public transport options are severely limited; bus service 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday and offers no service during evenings or Sundays. The lack of sustainable transport options clearly contravenes Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework, emphasizing sustainability.

The infrastructure claims associated with this application are equally troubling. There is no substantiated evidence supporting the economic viability of providing 50% affordable housing. While land is offered for a new school, construction funding remains unaddressed, leaving critical educational infrastructure inadequately planned. Vaguely defined s106 "contributions" for highway improvements lack enforceable commitments, and biodiversity net gain plans remain unsecured without a management strategy in place prior to occupation.

Moreover, local services are already stretched beyond capacity. Forest Hall School is at its limit, necessitating that children travel considerable distances for education. GP appointments routinely require a wait of two to three weeks, further straining community resources. Traffic congestion on Cambridge Road persists as a daily issue during peak hours, exacerbated by annual increases in local flooding incidents.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, transportation inadequacies, and unsupported infrastructure provisions, I urge you to refuse this planning application in order to protect our area’s heritage and sustainability effectively.

## Objection 2

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived here for 8 years with my family

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement coalescence, safeguarding heritage asset settings, maintaining strategic gaps. NPPF paragraph 138 purposes are clearly met.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The nearest station is 2.1km via the B1383 which has no footway, a 6% gradient, and no street lighting. Bus route 308 is hourly Monday-Saturday only, last bus 6:30pm. This location is car-dependent and fails NPPF Para 155 sustainability requirements.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Developer claims 50% affordable but no viability study proves it's deliverable. School infrastructure is LAND not funded BUILDINGS. Highway capacity upgrades unfunded. BNG relies on off-site compensation. No legal agreements tie delivery to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is at capacity - local children denied places. GP surgeries oversubscribed - weeks of waiting for appointments. Traffic is gridlocked during commute times on all main routes. Drainage system cannot cope causing repeated flooding.

I am writing to object to the planning application for development on this Green Belt land, where my family and I have lived for eight years.

This area serves vital Green Belt functions as outlined in paragraph 138 of the NPPF. The land prevents the merging of nearby settlements, safeguards heritage asset settings, and maintains strategic gaps essential to preserving our village's character. The proposed development would severely impact both the spatial and visual openness, which are fundamental aspects of Green Belt policy.

Regarding location and transport, the site is inherently car-dependent. The nearest train station is 2.1 kilometers away along the B1383, a route with no footway, steep gradients, and absent street lighting. Public transport options are insufficient; bus route 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday with a last service at 6:30 pm. This fails to meet the sustainability requirements set out in NPPF Paragraph 155, leaving residents reliant on private vehicles.

Moreover, there are significant concerns about local infrastructure capabilities. The developer's assertion of providing 50% affordable housing lacks substantiation by a viability study. Our primary school facilities offer land but lack funding for necessary buildings, while highway capacity upgrades remain financially unsupported. Biodiversity net gain plans rely on off-site compensation without binding legal agreements to ensure delivery aligns with occupation triggers.

The site's unsuitability for development is further evidenced by current infrastructure strains. Forest Hall School is already at full capacity, resulting in local children being denied places. GP surgeries are oversubscribed, leading to weeks-long waiting times for appointments. Traffic congestion during peak hours affects all major routes, exacerbating existing gridlock issues. Additionally, our drainage system is inadequate and frequently results in flooding during adverse weather conditions.

In light of these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, transport inadequacies, and critical infrastructure shortfalls, I urge you to refuse this application to protect the interests of our community and its environment.

## Objection 3

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident of this community for 14 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This land stops villages merging into urban sprawl, protects the Grade I listed church historic setting, and maintains separation from Bishop's Stortford. These are core Green Belt purposes that cannot be compromised.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to Stansted station is 2.1km via the B1383 without footways. Bus 308: hourly Mon-Sat, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. Nearest shops 1.8km. This is a car-dependent location failing DfT walkability standards and NPPF sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing viability at 50% is unproven. School commitment is land only - construction funding unaddressed (£10m+ cost). Highway upgrades lack specific commitments. BNG dependent on off-site delivery. No Section 106 agreements securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School places unavailable - Forest Hall oversubscribed, children sent miles away. GP appointment waits are 2-3 weeks at both local practices. B1383 traffic at standstill rush hour. Birchanger Lane floods after every heavy rainfall.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land within our community, where I have been a resident for 14 years.

The land in question plays a critical role in preventing urban sprawl by maintaining a clear separation between our village and Bishop's Stortford. It also protects the historic setting of the Grade I listed church, which is an invaluable heritage asset. These functions are essential components of Green Belt policy that must remain uncompromised, as they safeguard both spatial and visual openness.

From a transport perspective, this location is fundamentally unsuitable for development. The site heavily relies on car usage due to insufficient public transportation options and inadequate walking infrastructure. Walking to Stansted station entails a 2.1-kilometer trek along the B1383, which lacks proper footways. Bus service 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday and ceases before evening, with no service at all on Sundays. Furthermore, with the nearest shops located 1.8 kilometers away, this proposal does not meet Department for Transport walkability standards or National Planning Policy Framework sustainability criteria.

The planning application fails to address significant infrastructure concerns. The viability of providing affordable housing at 50% remains unproven without clear evidence or commitments. Although there is mention of land dedication for school purposes, no funding strategy has been outlined for construction—which would exceed £10 million—nor are there any binding Section 106 agreements ensuring delivery before occupation begins. Local schools such as Forest Hall are already oversubscribed, leading children to attend distant institutions. Additionally, GP practices struggle with appointment wait times extending up to three weeks.

Moreover, the local road network is under strain; traffic congestion is particularly severe during rush hours on the B1383, while Birchanger Lane frequently experiences flooding after heavy rainfall. Highway upgrades lack specific commitments necessary to mitigate these existing issues effectively.

Given these substantial concerns about Green Belt purposes and infrastructural inadequacies, I urge you to reject this planning application outright.

## Objection 4

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living here for the past 11 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This site serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement merger, protecting the historic church setting that dates to the 12th century, and maintaining the Bishop's Stortford separation gap. Without this land, continuous urban sprawl would result.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The nearest station is 2.1km away with no safe walking route. Public transport is one bus per hour Mon-Sat, finishing at 6:30pm. This is a car-dependent location that cannot meet NPPF sustainable development requirements.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The "Golden Rules" lack enforceable Section 106 agreements: school land offered but building costs unfunded, highway mitigation is vague "contributions", affordable housing viability not proven, BNG delivery relies on off-site units. Nothing is legally tied to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP practice (Lower Street) has 3-week wait times. Forest Hall School rejected my child due to oversubscription. Traffic gridlock on B1383 and Cambridge Road is daily occurrence. Surface water flooding gets worse with each new development.

### Generated Objection Letter

```
I am writing to object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in this area for the past 11 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical functions that this land serves. It effectively prevents the merger of settlements and protects the historic setting of our 12th-century church. The preservation of separation between Bishop's Stortford and surrounding areas is vital to maintain local character and prevent continuous urban sprawl.

The transport infrastructure for the proposed site is inadequate for sustainable development as defined by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The nearest railway station is situated 2.1 kilometers away with no safe walking path, making it heavily reliant on car travel. Public transport options are limited, with buses running only once per hour from Monday to Saturday, ceasing operations early each evening at 6:30 pm. This inadequacy underscores the unsustainable nature of the location in terms of reducing dependence on private vehicles.

Additionally, there are significant concerns regarding local infrastructure and services. Current "Golden Rules" lack enforceable Section 106 agreements, leading to uncertainty about crucial community provisions. While school land has been offered, there are no funds secured for building costs. Highway contributions remain vague without specific commitments, and affordable housing viability lacks substantiation. Biodiversity net gain delivery is contingent upon off-site measures not guaranteed by legal obligations tied to occupation triggers.

This location is unsuitable for further development based on my experiences with existing local services. My family’s GP practice on Lower Street suffers from extensive wait times of up to three weeks, indicating a healthcare system already under strain. Furthermore, Forest Hall School could not accommodate my child due to oversubscription issues. Traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road occurs daily, exacerbating commuting difficulties and increasing risks associated with surface water flooding—a situation worsening with each new development.

Given these substantial concerns related to Green Belt purposes, transport sustainability, and infrastructure inadequacies, I urge you to refuse this application decisively.

## Objection 5

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been here for 22 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land prevents merger of settlements, each with over 1,000 years of history. It protects the setting of a nationally important heritage asset. It maintains strategic separation preventing continuous development to Bishop's Stortford.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from Stansted station with NO continuous footway, failing the DfT 800m walkability standard. Bus 308 runs hourly Mon-Sat only, last bus at 6:30pm, NO Sunday service. This forces car-dependency with an estimated 1,180 daily car trips.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Developer promises 50% affordable housing but provides no viability evidence it's deliverable. School expansion is LAND ONLY - who funds the actual buildings, teachers, equipment? Highway upgrades are vague s106 contributions. BNG off-site creates delivery risk. No binding triggers preventing occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare overwhelmed - my GP has 3-week appointment waits. Schools at capacity - Forest Hall rejected local applications. Traffic gridlocked on B1383 and Cambridge Road every rush hour. Flooding occurs regularly making lanes impassable.

### Generated Objection Letter

```
I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident in this area for 22 years, I have witnessed firsthand the integral role this land plays in preserving the historical identity and spatial separation of our settlements. The land acts as a crucial buffer between historically significant communities, each with over a millennium of history. It also safeguards the setting of a nationally recognized heritage asset, reinforcing its importance beyond mere open space.

The proposed development would severely compromise both the spatial and visual openness that are essential to maintaining these Green Belt purposes. Such an intrusion not only threatens the character of our local environment but also sets a precedent for continuous urban sprawl towards Bishop's Stortford, undermining strategic planning objectives.

Transportation infrastructure is another critical concern. The site is located 2.1 kilometers from Stansted station without a continuous footpath, falling short of the Department for Transport's 800-meter walkability standard. The limited public transport options exacerbate car dependency, with an estimated 1,180 additional daily car trips likely to congest already overburdened roads such as the B1383 and Cambridge Road during peak hours.

The developer’s promise of 50% affordable housing lacks substantiated viability. Furthermore, while land has been allocated for school expansion, there are no clear commitments regarding funding for necessary facilities or staffing. Highway improvements remain ambiguous under vague s106 contributions without binding triggers to ensure timely delivery.

Moreover, healthcare services in our community are already stretched beyond capacity, with GP appointments requiring up to three weeks' wait time—an untenable situation that would only worsen with increased population density. Local schools like Forest Hall have declined applications due to existing capacity constraints.

In summary, this location is unsuitable for development due to its key role within the Green Belt framework and its inability to support further infrastructural demands without compromising quality of life and historical preservation.

I urge you to reject this application in order to protect our community's heritage and sustainable future.

## Objection 6

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been in Birchanger for 9 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land serves fundamental Green Belt purposes: preventing coalescence between settlements, safeguarding designated heritage assets, maintaining strategic gaps. Development would undermine all three purposes simultaneously.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to the station is 2.1km on the B1383 with no footway, steep gradient, no lighting. Bus service is inadequate for daily needs - hourly weekdays only. This fails basic sustainability tests for accessible locations.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing viability is unproven at 50%. School expansion commitment is LAND not BUILDINGS - who pays construction costs? Highway contributions are vague and unfunded. BNG off-site creates delivery uncertainty. None of these promises are legally secured via enforceable Section 106.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is full - children being sent to distant schools. GP appointment waits are 3 weeks at local surgeries. B1383 and Cambridge Road gridlocked morning and evening. Birchanger Lane floods regularly after heavy rainfall.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land in Birchanger.

Having resided in Birchanger for nine years, I have firsthand awareness of how this land upholds fundamental Green Belt purposes. It effectively prevents the coalescence between nearby settlements and safeguards designated heritage assets while maintaining critical strategic gaps. The proposed development would significantly undermine these essential functions, compromising both the spatial and visual openness that defines our village's character.

In terms of location and transport, the site is notably unsuitable for additional development. Accessing public transportation involves a 2.1-kilometer walk along the B1383, a route lacking footways, adequate lighting, and possessing a steep gradient. The current bus service is infrequent, operating only on an hourly basis during weekdays, which fails to meet basic sustainability criteria for accessible locations. The necessity for car dependency remains prevalent due to these limitations.

Furthermore, several "Golden Rules" concerns remain unaddressed. The viability of providing affordable housing at 50% is not substantiated, and commitments regarding school expansion are limited to land provision without clarity on construction funding responsibilities. Highway contributions appear vague and lack appropriate funding allocation. Additionally, the biodiversity net gain (BNG) proposal relies on off-site measures that create uncertainty about delivery. None of these elements are legally secured through enforceable Section 106 agreements.

Local infrastructure issues exacerbate these problems; Forest Hall School is already at capacity with children needing placement in distant schools. Local GP services face significant strain with appointment waits extending up to three weeks. Moreover, frequent gridlock occurs along B1383 and Cambridge Road during peak times while Birchanger Lane experiences regular flooding after heavy rainfall.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt impact, inadequate transportation options, unsubstantiated benefits claims, and pressing infrastructure deficits, I respectfully urge you to refuse this planning application in order to protect our community's integrity and resources.

## Objection 7

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Moved here 12 years ago

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The Green Belt prevents Birchanger-Stansted merger which would destroy community identity. The church setting depends on countryside views. The Bishop's Stortford gap is already under pressure. This land is essential Green Belt.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no walkable access to the station - 2.1km with no footway and steep hills. The bus runs once an hour weekdays, no Sundays, last service 6:30pm. This is fundamentally car-dependent and unsustainable.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The school offer is land only - no funding commitment for buildings, staffing, or equipment. Highway upgrades are listed as s106 "contributions" without specific amounts or triggers. BNG relies on off-site units. Affordable housing at 50% has no viability evidence. No binding legal agreements.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School has rejected local children due to capacity. GP appointment waits are 2-3 weeks at Lower Street surgery. B1383 and Cambridge Road are gridlocked morning and evening. Birchanger Lane floods making it impassable after heavy rain.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in the area for 12 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this land plays in preserving our community's distinct identity. The Green Belt effectively prevents the merger of Birchanger and Stansted, which would otherwise obliterate the unique character of both communities. Moreover, the setting of our local church relies heavily on its countryside views, integral not only to its historical context but also to our community’s cultural heritage. The narrow gap between Bishop's Stortford and surrounding areas is already under considerable pressure; thus, maintaining the integrity of this land as part of the essential Green Belt is paramount.

The proposed development site is fundamentally unsuitable due to its reliance on car travel, which contradicts sustainable transport principles. The distance to the nearest station is 2.1 kilometers without a footway and involves traversing steep hills, making walking an impractical option. Additionally, public transport services are inadequate, with buses running infrequently during weekdays and not at all on Sundays after 6:30 pm. This car dependency exacerbates existing congestion issues on B1383 and Cambridge Road, both of which experience severe gridlock during peak times.

Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding infrastructure provisions associated with this proposal. While there is mention of a school site offer, it lacks any concrete commitment to funding buildings or staffing requirements. Highway improvements are vaguely defined as Section 106 contributions without specified amounts or implementation triggers. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) depends on off-site units rather than enhancing local ecology directly. Claims of delivering 50% affordable housing lack accompanying viability evidence or binding legal agreements necessary for assurance.

Local services already face strains; Forest Hall School has turned away local children due to capacity constraints, while residents endure waiting periods of two to three weeks for GP appointments at Lower Street surgery. Birchanger Lane frequently experiences flooding after heavy rains, rendering it impassable and highlighting further infrastructural inadequacies.

Given these substantive concerns about detrimental impacts on Green Belt purposes and unsustainable infrastructure proposals, I urge you to reject this planning application in order to protect our community's character and sustainability.

## Objection 8

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident of Stansted for 15 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This site serves multiple Green Belt purposes: prevents coalescence of historic villages, safeguards the 12th-century church setting, maintains the Bishop's Stortford gap. Development would breach all three purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no safe walking route to the station 2.1km away - no footways, steep hills, unlit. The bus runs once per hour weekdays, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. This is fundamentally unsustainable and car-dependent.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer promises school land but no funded buildings, highway contributions without binding amounts, BNG off-site with no management plan, 50% affordable without viability proof. These are unenforceable promises, not legally secured commitments.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP surgery (Church Road) is overwhelmed - impossible to get appointments. Forest Hall School has rejected local children due to oversubscription. B1383 traffic is at a standstill during rush hour. Drainage cannot cope with current development.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land in Stansted.

Having resided in this area for 15 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this site contributes significantly to the purposes of the Green Belt. It plays a crucial role in preventing the coalescence of historic villages, safeguarding the setting of our 12th-century church, and maintaining the essential gap between our community and Bishop's Stortford. The proposed development would irreversibly breach these protective measures, undermining both spatial and visual openness that define our local character.

In terms of transportation and location suitability, the proposed site is fundamentally unsustainable without viable alternatives to car dependency. There is no safe walking route available to the station situated 2.1 kilometers away; paths are non-existent, with steep hills and unlit roads posing significant safety concerns. Public transport options are inadequate; buses operate only once per hour during weekdays, with no service after 6:30 pm or on Sundays.

The developer’s assurances regarding local infrastructure strain credibility. Promises such as providing land for a school lack commitment to funding necessary buildings. Highway contributions are mentioned without specified amounts or binding agreements. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) provisions are off-site with no management plan in place, while claims of delivering 50% affordable housing lack viability evidence to ensure their delivery.

From my experience, this location is unsuitable for further development due to existing infrastructure limitations. My GP surgery at Church Road is overwhelmed, making appointments nearly impossible. Forest Hall School has been unable to accommodate local children due to oversubscription issues. Additionally, traffic congestion on B1383 reaches a standstill during peak hours, and current drainage systems struggle under existing pressures.

Given these concerns, I respectfully urge that this application be refused due to its detrimental impact on our community's heritage, character, and sustainability. Thank you for considering my objection based on genuine observations from longstanding residency in Stansted.

## Objection 9

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Long-time resident of 30 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land strongly prevents Birchanger-Stansted coalescence which would destroy both communities' distinct identities. It safeguards heritage assets including the 12th-century church. It maintains strategic separation from Bishop's Stortford.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Access to the station requires 2.1km walk with no footway. Public transport is minimal - bus 308 hourly Mon-Sat only, stops at 6:30pm. Local services 1.8km away. This fails all sustainability tests for accessible locations.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The "Golden Rules" lack legal enforceability: school land without building funding commitments, highway mitigation as vague "contributions", BNG off-site without 30-year plans, 50% affordable without viability evidence. Nothing tied to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare crisis - my GP surgery has 3-week appointment waits. School capacity exhausted - Forest Hall full, no sixth form. Road network gridlocked every rush hour on B1383 and Cambridge Road. Flooding occurs regularly on local lanes.

I am writing to object to the planning application concerning this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident of this area for 30 years, I have witnessed firsthand the significant role this land plays in maintaining the distinct identities of Birchanger and Stansted by preventing their coalescence. The proposal threatens this fundamental purpose, undermining both communities' unique character and heritage, including safeguarding the historic 12th-century church. Additionally, it compromises strategic separation from Bishop's Stortford, which is vital for preserving our local landscape.

In terms of location and transport issues, the proposed site is demonstrably car-dependent. It fails critical sustainability benchmarks due to its inadequate public transport options and lack of safe pedestrian access. Residents face a 2.1-kilometer walk to reach the station without any footway, while bus service 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday, ceasing operations at 6:30 pm. Furthermore, essential services are situated 1.8 kilometers away, exacerbating accessibility concerns.

The purported benefits outlined in the "Golden Rules" lack enforceable assurances. Promises such as providing school land are not backed by any commitment to building funding. Highway mitigation remains unspecified beyond vague "contributions," while biodiversity net gain (BNG) plans are off-site without binding 30-year management strategies. Claims of delivering 50% affordable housing remain unsubstantiated by viability evidence or occupation-linked triggers.

This location is unsuitable for development due to existing infrastructure inadequacies I have personally encountered. Our local healthcare system is overwhelmed; my GP surgery has appointment waits extending to three weeks. Schools like Forest Hall have reached capacity with no provision for sixth form education. Furthermore, daily congestion chokes our road network during rush hours on B1383 and Cambridge Road, while frequent flooding plagues nearby lanes.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt purposes, transportation deficiencies, non-enforceable promises within the "Golden Rules," and strained local infrastructure, I urge you to refuse this application.

## Objection 10

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been here for 23 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt prevents the villages from becoming one merged settlement. The historic St Mary's Church relies on this countryside setting. The gap to Bishop's Stortford would be eliminated. These are fundamental Green Belt purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The location is 2.1km from public transport with no safe pedestrian route. Bus service is minimal - hourly on weekdays only, stops at 6:30pm. This forces car-ownership and fails to meet sustainable location criteria.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer offers school land but no commitment to fund construction, fit-out, or staffing. Highway mitigation lacks specific financial commitments or delivery timelines. BNG dependent on off-site units. 50% affordable housing lacks open-book viability assessment proving deliverability.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare access is dire - my GP practice has 3-week wait times for routine appointments. Schools are full - Forest Hall rejected local applications. Traffic on the B1383 and Cambridge Road is gridlocked. Surface water flooding occurs regularly.

### Generated Objection Letter

```
I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having lived in this area for 23 years, I am deeply concerned about the detrimental impact the proposal will have on both the character and functionality of our community.

The land in question serves crucial Green Belt purposes by maintaining a clear separation between our village and Bishop's Stortford. The unique countryside setting around the historic St Mary's Church is integral to its heritage value, which would be irreparably compromised by such development. Furthermore, merging the villages into a contiguous settlement undermines the very essence of preserving our local identity and open spaces.

The proposal’s reliance on car travel highlights serious shortcomings in location suitability. With public transport options severely limited—an hourly bus service that ceases at 6:30 pm and no safe pedestrian pathways—the site fails to meet essential criteria for sustainable development. The dependency on private vehicles not only contravenes sustainability goals but also exacerbates existing traffic congestion on the B1383 and Cambridge Road, where gridlock is already a daily issue.

Moreover, promises made by developers regarding infrastructure improvements lack concrete commitments. The offer of school land without assured funding for construction or staffing renders it an empty gesture rather than a genuine enhancement. Similarly, highway mitigation plans are vague, offering neither financial specifics nor timelines for implementation. The requirement for biodiversity net gain through off-site units further detracts from local ecological benefits intended by such measures.

Healthcare access is another pressing concern; my GP practice currently experiences significant delays with routine appointment wait times extending up to three weeks. Local schools are similarly overburdened, as evidenced by Forest Hall's inability to accommodate all local applicants.

In summary, given these substantial issues related to Green Belt impacts, transportation inadequacies, and insufficient infrastructure support, I urge you to refuse this planning application. It poses considerable harm to our community’s quality of life and disregards fundamental planning considerations aimed at protecting both heritage and environment.

## Objection 11

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident for 13 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt prevents urban sprawl between Birchanger, Stansted and Bishop's Stortford. It safeguards the medieval church's rural character. It maintains village separation that has existed since the Domesday Book. Strong Green Belt function.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from public transport with dangerous pedestrian access (no footway, gradient, unlit). Bus service inadequate - hourly weekdays only. This location is car-dependent with estimated 1,180 daily car trips, failing NPPF Para 155.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer offers school LAND but not funded BUILDINGS - who pays for construction, equipment, and teachers? Highway mitigation is listed as vague "s106 contribution" without binding amounts or delivery triggers. BNG relies on off-site units with no 30-year management plan secured. No commitments are tied to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Schools are oversubscribed - Forest Hall turning away local residents. GP practices overwhelmed - impossible to get timely appointments. Traffic infrastructure at capacity - gridlock on B1383 daily. Surface water drainage inadequate causing regular flooding.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having resided in this area for 13 years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this Green Belt plays in preventing urban sprawl between Birchanger, Stansted, and Bishop's Stortford. The proposed development threatens to undermine the historical separation of these communities, a division that has been preserved since the Domesday Book. The medieval church's rural character is safeguarded by this Green Belt; any encroachment would irreparably harm both its spatial and visual openness.

The location in question presents significant transport challenges. Situated 2.1km from public transport links, pedestrian access is perilously unsafe due to the absence of footways, steep gradients, and lack of lighting. The existing bus service is inadequate—running only hourly on weekdays—rendering the site heavily car-dependent with an anticipated 1,180 daily car trips. This fails to meet the criteria set forth in NPPF Paragraph 155 regarding sustainable transport.

Further concerns arise from the proposal's impact on local infrastructure. While land for a new school has been offered, there are no provisions for funding construction or staffing—the financial burden remains unaddressed. Highway improvements are vaguely defined as "s106 contributions," lacking specific amounts or delivery timelines. Additionally, Biodiversity Net Gain plans are reliant on off-site units without a secured 30-year management plan or occupation-linked commitments.

In my experience, this location is unsuitable for such development due to already overburdened services. Local schools like Forest Hall are turning away residents due to oversubscription; GP practices struggle with overwhelming demand; traffic congestion is severe along B1383; and surface water drainage systems frequently fail, resulting in regular flooding.

Given these substantial issues, I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect our community’s character and sustainability.

## Objection 12

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived in the village for 16 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The gap between settlements would be eliminated, causing coalescence. The historic church setting relies on open countryside. Bishop's Stortford separation would be breached. This land strongly serves Green Belt purposes under NPPF paragraph 138.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Access to public transport is inadequate - 2.1km to station via roads without footways. Bus route 308 runs hourly weekdays only, stops early evening. This fails the DfT 800m walkable distance standard for daily trips.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School commitment is LAND ONLY - where is the £10-15 million needed for buildings? Highway capacity upgrades are unfunded "contributions". BNG is off-site without enforceable 30-year management. Affordable housing viability at 50% is not evidenced. These are vague promises.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is full - local children being turned away. GP surgeries overwhelmed - weeks of wait for appointments. B1383 traffic is at capacity - gridlock daily during commute times. Existing drainage infrastructure cannot cope with current levels.

I am writing to object to the planning application concerning the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in our village for 16 years, I am deeply familiar with the area's character and the essential purposes served by the Green Belt. This land acts as a crucial buffer between settlements, preventing coalescence that would otherwise compromise the distinctive setting of our historic church and breach the separation from Bishop's Stortford. Such development contravenes the principles outlined in NPPF paragraph 138, which emphasize maintaining openness and permanence.

The proposal's location is inherently unsuited to support additional development due to inadequate transport infrastructure. The nearest railway station is 2.1 kilometers away, accessible only via roads lacking footways, while bus route 308 offers limited service confined to weekdays with early evening termination. This arrangement fails to meet the Department for Transport's standard of an 800-meter walkable distance for regular trips, underscoring the site's car dependency.

Claims regarding infrastructure improvements lack substantiation or enforceability. The promise of a new school remains unfulfilled without financial backing for construction costs estimated between £10-15 million. Highway capacity enhancements are vaguely promised through unfunded contributions, and Biodiversity Net Gain is relegated off-site without a binding management plan spanning three decades. Moreover, the viability of providing 50% affordable housing has not been convincingly demonstrated.

Local services are already stretched beyond capacity, as evidenced by Forest Hall School turning away local children and GP surgeries subjecting patients to protracted waits for appointments. Additionally, B1383 experiences daily gridlock during peak hours, and existing drainage systems struggle with current demands.

Given these compelling concerns about transport inadequacies, heritage preservation, ecological impacts, and overstretched infrastructure, I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect our community’s integrity and quality of life.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been a resident for 19 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The gap between Birchanger and Stansted is already narrow at just 1.2km. This land is essential to prevent coalescence. The medieval church setting depends on open countryside. The Bishop's Stortford gap would be breached.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Access to the station is 2.1km with no footway, dangerous for pedestrians. Bus 308 frequency is poor (hourly), no evening or weekend service. This fails the DfT 800m walkability standard and NPPF sustainability requirements.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer claims 50% affordable but provides no evidence it's economically viable. School commitment is land only, not funded buildings. Highway mitigation lacks binding financial commitments. BNG dependent on off-site compensation with no 30-year plan secured.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is oversubscribed - no places for local children, no sixth form forcing travel to Bishop's Stortford. GP surgeries are at breaking point - 3 week waits for appointments. Roads are gridlocked every morning and evening rush hour.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident of this area for 19 years, I am acutely aware of its value and the essential role it plays in maintaining the separation between Birchanger and Stansted. The gap, already narrow at 1.2 kilometers, would be further compromised by this development, risking coalescence that would undermine the unique setting of our medieval church and breach the Bishop's Stortford boundary. The impact on spatial and visual openness would be significant and unacceptable.

In terms of transport and accessibility, this proposal falls short in several critical aspects. The distance to the nearest station is 2.1 kilometers with no pedestrian footway, creating hazardous conditions for walkers. Additionally, public transportation options are insufficient; Bus 308 operates only hourly without evening or weekend service. This situation fails to meet both the Department for Transport's 800-meter walkability standard and the sustainability requirements set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).

The infrastructure realities further highlight why this location is unsuitable for such development. Although there is a claim of providing 50% affordable housing, no evidence has been presented to demonstrate its economic viability. The offer concerning school facilities is limited to land provision without funding for necessary buildings. Furthermore, highway mitigation lacks any binding financial commitments. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) plans rely on off-site compensation arrangements that remain unsecured over a necessary 30-year timeframe.

Local services are already under strain; Forest Hall School lacks capacity, forcing families to seek education outside our community due to oversubscription and absence of a sixth form. GP surgeries face similar pressures with appointment waits extending up to three weeks. Daily traffic congestion exacerbates these issues during peak hours.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt harm, inadequate transport links, unsatisfactory infrastructure guarantees, and overstretched local services, I urge you to refuse this application in order to preserve the integrity and character of our community.

## Objection 14

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living locally for 21 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The site maintains the essential gap between settlements that has existed for over 1,000 years. It protects the medieval church setting and prevents coalescence with Bishop's Stortford. This clearly serves multiple Green Belt purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to the station is 2.1km with no safe footway, steep gradients, and unlit sections. Public transport is inadequate - hourly buses weekdays only, no evening or Sunday service. Residents would be entirely car-dependent.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing: No open-book viability assessment proves 50% is deliverable. Infrastructure: Developer offers land for school but no commitment to fund actual buildings. Highway upgrades are unfunded "contributions". BNG is off-site with delivery risk. Nothing is legally secured before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School places are unavailable - Forest Hall oversubscribed, children traveling miles. GP appointments take weeks to get at both local surgeries. Morning and evening traffic is gridlocked on all main roads. Flooding on Birchanger Lane after heavy rain.

I am writing to formally object to the planning application concerning this Green Belt land.

Having resided in this area for 21 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this land serves crucial Green Belt purposes. It maintains the vital separation between our community and Bishop’s Stortford, a distinction that has been preserved for over a millennium. The proposed development threatens this essential gap and risks encroaching upon the historically significant setting of our medieval church, thereby undermining multiple Green Belt objectives of preventing urban sprawl.

From a transport perspective, the site is undeniably car-dependent due to inadequate public transport options and lack of safe pedestrian routes. The nearest train station is 2.1 kilometers away with no safe footways; steep gradients and unlit paths further exacerbate access issues. The hourly bus service operates only on weekdays without evening or Sunday provision, leaving residents reliant on private vehicles. This would significantly increase traffic congestion on already gridlocked roads during peak hours.

The proposal raises serious concerns about local infrastructure capability. There is no open-book viability assessment to confirm the deliverability of 50% affordable housing, casting doubt on its feasibility. While land has been offered for a new school, there is no financial commitment from the developer towards constructing necessary facilities. Contributions towards highway improvements remain unfunded promises rather than secured commitments, and plans for off-site Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) present significant delivery risks without legal guarantees before occupation.

In terms of community resources, current provisions are insufficient to accommodate additional residents. Local schools like Forest Hall are oversubscribed, forcing children to travel significant distances daily. Both local GP surgeries struggle with capacity, leading to long wait times for appointments. Additionally, Birchanger Lane frequently experiences flooding after heavy rainfall, posing further challenges that remain unaddressed by this proposal.

Given these factors—including harm to Green Belt integrity, inadequate transport solutions, unsubstantiated benefits claims, and overstretched infrastructure—I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect our community's character and sustainability.

## Objection 15

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident for 26 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This land prevents Birchanger and Stansted from merging into one continuous urban sprawl. It safeguards the 12th-century St Mary's Church historic setting and maintains the crucial separation gap with Bishop's Stortford. These are CORE Green Belt functions under NPPF.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from the nearest station with no continuous footway, 6% gradient, unlit sections. Bus 308: hourly Mon-Sat, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. Local shops 1.8km away. Entirely car-dependent, failing sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School infrastructure: developer offers land but no funded buildings - this is meaningless without committed funding. Highway upgrades are unfunded. Affordable housing at 50% lacks viability assessment. BNG is off-site with delivery risk. No legal commitments securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity crisis - Forest Hall full, no local provision. Healthcare access dire - GP surgeries overwhelmed with 3-week waits. Road infrastructure at breaking point - gridlock morning and evening. Flooding on Birchanger Lane regularly.

I am writing to express my objection to this planning application.

Having resided in this area for 26 years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this Green Belt land plays in maintaining the distinct identities of Birchanger and Stansted. The proposed development would significantly compromise these core Green Belt purposes, as outlined under the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), by eroding the separation that prevents urban sprawl and endangering the historic setting of St Mary's Church, a heritage asset from the 12th century.

From a transport perspective, the development site is poorly situated. It is located 2.1km from the nearest train station without adequate pedestrian pathways; parts of the route are unlit, with a challenging gradient of 6%. Public transport options are limited, with Bus 308 offering only hourly services from Monday to Saturday and no service on Sundays. Local amenities are similarly distant at 1.8km away, rendering future residents heavily reliant on car travel. This fails key sustainability criteria, particularly given current environmental commitments to reduce carbon dependency.

Further compounding these concerns are deficiencies in local infrastructure. The proposal to offer land for school expansion lacks substantive value without a commitment to fund necessary building projects. Similarly, highway improvements remain unfunded, undermining their feasibility. Claims regarding affordable housing provision lack detailed viability assessments, while biodiversity net gain (BNG) plans rely on off-site solutions that carry substantial delivery risks without legal assurances prior to occupation.

This location's suitability for development is further challenged by existing pressures on local services. There is a critical shortage of school capacity—Forest Hall School is already operating at full capacity—and healthcare access remains strained with excessive waiting times at GP surgeries extending up to three weeks. Additionally, local road infrastructure suffers frequent congestion during peak hours, exacerbated by regular flooding incidents on Birchanger Lane.

Given these significant concerns related to Green Belt functions, unsustainable transport reliance, unverified infrastructure promises, and existing service inadequacies, I urge you to refuse this application for development on this site.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living in the area for 10 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt stops Birchanger and Stansted becoming indistinguishable suburbs. The historic church would lose its rural setting. The gap to Bishop's Stortford is already minimal and would be eliminated. Strong Green Belt contribution.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The location is 2.1km from Stansted station with no pedestrian infrastructure. Bus route 308 operates hourly Mon-Sat only, no Sunday or evening service. Residents would be forced into car ownership, failing NPPF sustainability criteria.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Developer offers school LAND but not funded BUILDINGS - this is a meaningless promise without funding. Highway capacity upgrades unfunded. BNG off-site with delivery risk. Affordable housing at 50% lacks viability proof. No binding Section 106 agreements.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School places denied - Forest Hall oversubscribed, no sixth form. GP services overwhelmed - weeks to get appointments. Road network at capacity - gridlock daily during commute times. Surface water flooding worsens with every development.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

In my ten years residing in this area, I have seen firsthand the critical role this Green Belt serves in maintaining the distinct identities of Birchanger and Stansted. The land in question prevents these areas from merging into indistinguishable suburbs and preserves the rural setting of our historic church. Furthermore, it acts as a vital buffer between our community and Bishop's Stortford, with this gap already perilously narrow. The proposal would eradicate this separation entirely, compromising the strong contribution of the Green Belt to both spatial and visual openness.

The proposed site is unsuitable for development due to its reliance on private vehicles. Located 2.1 kilometers from Stansted station and lacking pedestrian infrastructure, residents would be compelled to own cars, directly contradicting the sustainability criteria set out by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The existing bus service, route 308, operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday, with no service on Sundays or evenings, further highlighting the inadequacy of public transport options.

Regarding infrastructure promises, they remain unconvincing and insufficiently secured. For instance, while land for a school is offered by developers, there is no commitment to fund necessary building developments—rendering such offers meaningless without financial backing. Highway capacity improvements also lack funding assurance, while biodiversity net gain plans rely on off-site delivery with inherent risks. The proposed affordable housing at 50% lacks demonstrated economic viability, and there are no binding Section 106 agreements to ensure these commitments are fulfilled.

The strain on local infrastructure is evident: school places are unavailable with Forest Hall oversubscribed and lacking a sixth form; GP services are overwhelmed with significant delays for appointments; and daily gridlock during peak times underscores that our road network has reached full capacity. Additionally, surface water flooding issues have been exacerbated by recent developments.

Given these substantial concerns relating to Green Belt purposes, transportation challenges, inadequate infrastructure proposals, and existing service limitations, I urge you to refuse this planning application for the benefit of our community's future integrity and sustainability.

## Objection 17

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been a local resident for over 25 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt maintains the essential gap between villages, protects the 12th-century church countryside setting, and prevents Bishop's Stortford merger. Development would undermine all three fundamental purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The location is 2.1km from the station with no continuous safe walking route. Public transport is hourly buses weekdays only, no evening or Sunday service. This fails to meet accessible location requirements under NPPF Para 155.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School expansion: land offered but who funds the £10-15 million buildings? Highway mitigation is vague "s106 contribution" without amounts or timelines. BNG off-site creates delivery uncertainty. Affordable housing at 50% lacks economic viability evidence.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity is exhausted - Forest Hall full, no sixth form provision. Healthcare access is critical - GP surgeries have 3-week waits. Road infrastructure is at breaking point - daily gridlock on main routes. Flooding worsens with each development.

I am writing to object to the planning application concerning the proposed development on this Green Belt land, where I have been a resident for over 25 years.

The land in question fulfills critical Green Belt purposes, preserving an essential gap between our villages and safeguarding the countryside setting of the historic 12th-century church. Moreover, it plays a vital role in preventing the merger with Bishop's Stortford. Development here would fundamentally undermine these purposes, eroding both spatial and visual openness integral to our community's character.

From a transportation perspective, the location is not suitable for development due to its reliance on private vehicles. The site is situated 2.1km from the nearest station without a continuous safe walking route, making it inaccessible under current National Planning Policy Framework guidelines (Paragraph 155). Public transport is insufficient, offering hourly bus services only on weekdays and excluding evenings and Sundays. This inadequacy fails to support sustainable travel options for future residents.

The infrastructure strains within our village further highlight this site's unsuitability for development. Local schools are at capacity, with Forest Hall unable to accommodate additional students and lacking sixth form provisions. Although there has been an offer of land for school expansion, no clear plan or funding source exists for the necessary £10-15 million buildings. Similarly, highway mitigation strategies remain vague, lacking specific contributions or timelines under section 106 agreements.

Additionally, healthcare services are stretched thin; residents experience delays of up to three weeks for GP appointments. Our roads suffer daily gridlock during peak hours, indicating that existing infrastructure cannot support increased traffic volumes. Flooding incidents have also become more frequent with each new development, exacerbating local concerns about environmental sustainability.

In light of these substantial issues regarding transport accessibility, heritage preservation, ecological impact, and infrastructural capacity, I urge you to refuse this application. The proposal poses significant risks to our community's integrity and quality of life while compromising essential Green Belt functions that have long protected this area’s unique rural character.

## Objection 18

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived locally for 17 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The site prevents urban sprawl by maintaining separation between distinct communities. It protects the 900-year-old church's countryside setting. It keeps Bishop's Stortford from merging with our villages. These are textbook Green Belt purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no continuous footway to the station 2.1km away, making walking dangerous especially for children and elderly. The bus service is hourly at best, stops at 6:30pm, doesn't run Sundays. This fails basic sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The school commitment is just LAND not funded buildings - where are the millions needed for construction? GP surgery capacity is not addressed. Highway mitigation lacks specific funding commitments. BNG is off-site with no enforceable management plan. These are promises without legal backing.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School turning away local children - oversubscribed. GP surgeries at capacity - impossible to get appointments within weeks. Traffic infrastructure failing - daily gridlock on main routes. Drainage inadequate causing regular flooding.

I am writing to formally object to the planning application concerning the development on this Green Belt land.

Having resided in the local community for 17 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this site effectively serves critical Green Belt purposes. It maintains a clear separation between our villages and Bishop's Stortford, preventing urban sprawl and safeguarding the distinct rural setting of the historic 900-year-old church. These functions are quintessential to preserving both spatial and visual openness.

The proposed development is particularly unsuitable due to significant transport and infrastructure concerns. The lack of a continuous footway to the train station, situated 2.1 kilometers away, poses a safety risk for pedestrians, especially children and the elderly. Public transport options are severely limited with an infrequent bus service that ceases operation by early evening and does not run on Sundays, rendering car dependency unavoidable. This fails fundamental sustainability criteria.

Moreover, the proposal inadequately addresses pressing infrastructure issues. While land has been earmarked for a new school, there are no secured funds for its construction—raising doubts about the viability of this commitment. Similarly, local GP surgeries are already operating at capacity, making it difficult for residents to secure timely appointments. The traffic congestion on main roads reflects a failing infrastructure incapable of accommodating additional demand. Furthermore, drainage systems are insufficient, leading to frequent flooding incidents.

Lastly, claims regarding ecological benefits through Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) are undermined by off-site initiatives lacking enforceable management plans—rendering such promises ineffective without legal guarantees.

Given these substantial concerns related to transport inadequacies, heritage preservation failures, and unsupported infrastructure commitments alongside crucial Green Belt considerations, I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect our community’s integrity and sustainability.

I am writing to formally object to the planning application concerning this Green Belt land in Birchanger, where I have resided for the past 20 years. The proposed development poses significant threats to both the spatial and visual openness that this area has long preserved.

This site plays a crucial role in maintaining distinct separations between our historic villages and safeguarding the setting of the 12th-century Grade I listed church. It also acts as a vital buffer, preventing encroachment towards Bishop's Stortford. Any development here would undermine these fundamental Green Belt purposes, which are essential to preserving the character and identity of our local community.

Transportation and access are further areas of concern. The site is situated 2.1 kilometers from the nearest station, with no safe pedestrian routes available, effectively making residents reliant on cars for basic needs such as commuting, shopping, and healthcare. The current public transport options are inadequate; there is only one bus per hour from Monday to Saturday with no service on Sundays, and the last bus departs at 6:30 pm. This lack of viable transport links emphasizes the unsuitability of this location for new development.

The promises made by developers regarding infrastructure improvements remain unconvincing due to their unenforceability. There is no proof of viability for delivering 50% affordable housing, nor funding allocated for school construction on promised land. Additionally, highway mitigation lacks specified commitments, while biodiversity net gain efforts off-site pose substantial delivery risks without secure Section 106 agreements or occupation triggers.

Local infrastructure could not sustain additional strain from new developments given its current state. Forest Hall School is already oversubscribed, as evidenced by my own child’s rejection, and GP appointments at Lower Street have a waiting period of three weeks. Traffic congestion on B1383 during peak hours is severe, and Birchanger Lane frequently becomes impassable due to flooding after heavy rains.

In light of these considerable concerns related to heritage preservation, infrastructure capacity, transportation inadequacies, and Green Belt objectives being compromised, I urge you to refuse this planning application for the continued wellbeing of our community and environment.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in our village for eight years with my family, I have come to understand the critical role this land plays in maintaining the separation between Birchanger and Stansted. The gap here is already quite narrow at just 1.2 kilometers, and developing this area would lead to coalescence, undermining one of the fundamental purposes of the Green Belt. Furthermore, the medieval church setting is reliant on its surrounding open countryside to preserve its historical integrity, and this proposal threatens to breach the visual openness that currently exists between Bishop's Stortford and neighboring areas.

Regarding transportation, the site is heavily dependent on private vehicles due to inadequate public transport options and pedestrian infrastructure. Access to Stansted station is 2.1 kilometers away without a safe footway for pedestrians, posing significant danger. The bus service (308) operates only hourly with no service during evenings or weekends, failing to meet both the Department for Transport's 800-meter walkability standard and National Planning Policy Framework sustainability criteria.

The proposed development raises substantial concerns about local infrastructure capacity and service provision. Despite offering school land, there are no commitments from developers regarding funding for necessary buildings or staffing, leaving questions about who will bear these costs unanswered. Highway mitigation measures are described vaguely as "s106 contributions" without specific financial commitments or clear delivery timelines. Moreover, biodiversity net gain relies on off-site units lacking a secured 30-year management plan and no assurances linked to occupation triggers.

This location is unsuitable for further development owing to existing pressures on community resources. Forest Hall School has already rejected my child due to oversubscription, lacking any sixth form provision. GP services at Lower Street involve waiting times of up to three weeks for appointments. Additionally, traffic congestion along B1383 occurs daily during peak hours, and Birchanger Lane becomes impassable following heavy rainfall due to flooding.

In light of these substantial issues impacting our local community’s character and sustainability, I urge you to refuse this application.

## Objection 22

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living in the area for 10 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt maintains the essential gap between villages, protects the 12th-century church countryside setting, and prevents Bishop's Stortford merger. Development would undermine all three fundamental purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from the nearest station with no continuous footway, 6% gradient, unlit sections. Bus 308: hourly Mon-Sat, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. Local shops 1.8km away. Entirely car-dependent, failing sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The school commitment is just LAND not funded buildings - where are the millions needed for construction? GP surgery capacity is not addressed. Highway mitigation lacks specific funding commitments. BNG is off-site with no enforceable management plan. These are promises without legal backing.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare access is dire - my GP practice has 3-week wait times for routine appointments. Schools are full - Forest Hall rejected local applications. Traffic on the B1383 and Cambridge Road is gridlocked. Surface water flooding occurs regularly.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in this area for ten years, I have observed firsthand the vital role this land plays in maintaining the essential separation between our village and neighboring communities. The development threatens to erode this gap, risking the merger of Bishop's Stortford with adjacent settlements and compromising the 12th-century church's historic countryside setting. These factors are critical to preserving both spatial and visual openness, core purposes of Green Belt designation.

The suitability of the location for development is further undermined by its poor transport connectivity. The site lies 2.1 kilometers from the nearest railway station, with no continuous footway, steep gradients, and unlit sections – rendering it unsuitable for safe pedestrian access. Public transportation options are severely limited, with Bus 308 operating only hourly from Monday to Saturday and ceasing service by early evening without any Sunday provision. Additionally, local amenities such as shops are located 1.8 kilometers away, making a car an unavoidable necessity for residents and thereby failing sustainability assessments.

Critical infrastructure concerns also warrant attention. The proposal offers merely a land allocation for a new school without securing funding for construction, raising questions about how such essential facilities will be delivered. Similarly, current GP services are overburdened; my own experience involves waiting three weeks for routine appointments at our local practice. Traffic congestion is another pressing issue, with frequent gridlock on roads like the B1383 and Cambridge Road exacerbating travel difficulties. Furthermore, there are recurring incidents of surface water flooding that seem inadequately addressed in current plans.

Promises surrounding highway improvements and biodiversity net gain (BNG) lack enforceable commitments or specific funding allocations, casting doubt on their viability. Without legally binding assurances, these proposed benefits appear speculative at best.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, transport inadequacies, infrastructure deficiencies, and unfunded commitments, I urge you to refuse this planning application to safeguard our community's character and sustainability.

## Objection 23

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived in Birchanger for 20 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement coalescence, safeguarding heritage asset settings, maintaining strategic gaps. NPPF paragraph 138 purposes are clearly met.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The nearest station is 2.1km away with no safe walking route. Public transport is one bus per hour Mon-Sat, finishing at 6:30pm. This is a car-dependent location that cannot meet NPPF sustainable development requirements.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing viability at 50% is unproven. School commitment is land only - construction funding unaddressed (£10m+ cost). Highway upgrades lack specific commitments. BNG dependent on off-site delivery. No Section 106 agreements securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP practice (Lower Street) has 3-week wait times. Forest Hall School rejected my child due to oversubscription. Traffic gridlock on B1383 and Cambridge Road is daily occurrence. Surface water flooding gets worse with each new development.

### Generated Objection Letter

```
I am writing to formally object to the planning application concerning the proposed development on this Green Belt land in Birchanger, where I have resided for the past 20 years.

The land in question fulfills essential Green Belt purposes as outlined in paragraph 138 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Specifically, it acts as a vital buffer preventing settlement coalescence and safeguards the settings of nearby heritage assets. Furthermore, it maintains strategic gaps that preserve both spatial and visual openness. The proposed development would significantly undermine these functions, resulting in an unacceptable impact on the area's character.

In terms of location and transport viability, this site is fundamentally car-dependent. The nearest railway station is 2.1 kilometers away, lacking any safe pedestrian routes. Public transport options are severely limited with only one bus per hour operating from Monday to Saturday, ending service by 6:30 pm. This scenario fails to align with NPPF's sustainable development criteria, which emphasize reducing reliance on private vehicles.

The proposal also raises substantial concerns regarding infrastructure capacity and service provision. The claim of delivering 50% affordable housing lacks substantiated viability evidence. Although there is a commitment to provide land for a new school, there are no secured funds for its construction, which is estimated to exceed £10 million. Additionally, necessary highway upgrades remain unspecified, while Biodiversity Net Gain appears reliant on off-site measures without clear execution plans or Section 106 agreements ensuring delivery prior to occupation.

From my personal experience within the community, local amenities are already strained; my GP practice experiences prolonged wait times of three weeks or more, and Forest Hall School has been unable to accommodate my child due to oversubscription. Traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road is a daily challenge exacerbated by existing developments. Furthermore, surface water flooding issues have intensified with each new project.

Given these considerations, I urge you to refuse this application based on its potential harm to our village's Green Belt integrity and existing infrastructure limitations.

## Objection 24

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Moved here 12 years ago

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt prevents the villages from becoming one merged settlement. The historic St Mary's Church relies on this countryside setting. The gap to Bishop's Stortford would be eliminated. These are fundamental Green Belt purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from the nearest station with no continuous footway, 6% gradient, unlit sections. Bus 308: hourly Mon-Sat, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. Local shops 1.8km away. Entirely car-dependent, failing sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Developer claims 50% affordable but no viability study proves it's deliverable. School infrastructure is LAND not funded BUILDINGS. Highway capacity upgrades unfunded. BNG relies on off-site compensation. No legal agreements tie delivery to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School turning away local children - oversubscribed. GP surgeries at capacity - impossible to get appointments within weeks. Traffic infrastructure failing - daily gridlock on main routes. Drainage inadequate causing regular flooding.

I am writing to express my strong objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in this area for 12 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this Green Belt serves in maintaining the distinctive identities of our villages. The proposed development would obliterate the gap between these settlements and Bishop's Stortford, thereby undermining a fundamental purpose of the Green Belt. Moreover, the historic St Mary's Church, which relies significantly on its countryside setting, would see its character and heritage compromised by such an encroachment.

Transportation is another significant concern. The site is situated 2.1 kilometers from the nearest railway station, yet lacks a continuous footway and includes sections with a 6% gradient that are unlit. Public transport options are limited; bus service 308 runs only hourly from Monday to Saturday with no service on Sundays, making reliance on cars unavoidable. This proposal fails basic sustainability criteria by not providing adequate pedestrian or cycling infrastructure.

The developer’s claims regarding affordable housing lack substantiation through a viability study, casting doubt on deliverability. The assertion that school infrastructure needs will be met is misleading; while there may be land allocated for school use, there is no funding provision for actual building construction. Furthermore, required highway capacity improvements remain unfunded. Biodiversity Net Gain plans rely heavily on off-site compensation without legal agreements linking these enhancements to specific development milestones.

Local services are already stretched beyond capacity. Forest Hall School cannot accommodate local children due to oversubscription. GP surgeries are overwhelmed, making timely appointments virtually impossible. Existing traffic infrastructure struggles daily under current conditions, leading to regular congestion and gridlock. Additionally, inadequate drainage systems contribute to frequent flooding issues in the area.

In light of these concerns—ranging from impacts on Green Belt purposes to failures in infrastructure and service adequacy—I urge you to refuse this application outright. Such development would impose irreversible damage on our community’s character and sustainability prospects.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living here for the past 11 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This land prevents Birchanger and Stansted from merging into one continuous urban sprawl. It safeguards the 12th-century St Mary's Church historic setting and maintains the crucial separation gap with Bishop's Stortford. These are CORE Green Belt functions under NPPF.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no walkable access to the station - 2.1km with no footway and steep hills. The bus runs once an hour weekdays, no Sundays, last service 6:30pm. This is fundamentally car-dependent and unsustainable.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Developer promises 50% affordable housing but provides no viability evidence it's deliverable. School expansion is LAND ONLY - who funds the actual buildings, teachers, equipment? Highway upgrades are vague s106 contributions. BNG off-site creates delivery risk. No binding triggers preventing occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is oversubscribed - no places for local children, no sixth form forcing travel to Bishop's Stortford. GP surgeries are at breaking point - 3 week waits for appointments. Roads are gridlocked every morning and evening rush hour.

I am writing to object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land, where I have resided for the past 11 years.

The land in question critically serves several Green Belt purposes as outlined by the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). It prevents Birchanger and Stansted from merging into a continuous urban sprawl and safeguards the historic setting of St Mary's Church, dating back to the 12th century. Additionally, it maintains the essential separation gap with Bishop's Stortford. Permitting development here would irreparably harm both the spatial and visual openness that our community relies upon.

Transport infrastructure is another significant concern. The location is fundamentally car-dependent due to inadequate public transport options. There is no walkable access to the station, which is 2.1 kilometers away with no footway and challenging terrain. The bus service operates only once an hour on weekdays, with no service on Sundays, and ceases operation by 6:30pm, further entrenching reliance on private vehicles and contravening sustainable development principles.

Moreover, there are substantial issues related to local infrastructure and services. The developer’s promise of delivering 50% affordable housing lacks supporting viability evidence or binding commitments. While there is mention of school expansion, it only entails land allocation without clarity on funding for necessary buildings, staff, or equipment. Highway upgrades are vaguely referred to as section 106 contributions without specifics on enforceability or timing. Additionally, Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) plans appear off-site, posing risks in delivery without defined triggers preventing premature occupation.

Finally, this location's unsuitability for development is evident through existing pressures on local amenities. Forest Hall School is oversubscribed with no capacity for additional local children; it lacks a sixth form, necessitating travel to Bishop’s Stortford for higher education. Our GP surgeries are overwhelmed with patients facing three-week waits for appointments. Traffic congestion during rush hours further exacerbates these challenges.

Given these serious concerns regarding Green Belt purposes, transport inadequacies, and overstressed infrastructure services, I respectfully urge you to refuse this application in order to preserve our community's character and sustainability.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having resided in this area for 23 years, I have seen firsthand the critical role this land plays in preventing the coalescence of two distinct medieval settlements. Furthermore, it safeguards the setting of a nationally designated heritage asset and maintains the strategic gap necessary to prevent sprawl along the M11 corridor. The contribution of this site to the Green Belt is undeniably strong, and its development would significantly undermine both its spatial and visual openness.

Transport infrastructure associated with this proposal is inadequate. Currently, walking to the nearest railway station involves navigating a 2.1km path that lacks a safe footway, compounded by steep gradients and unlit sections. Public transport options are limited at best, with only hourly bus services on weekdays and no service in evenings or on Sundays. As such, residents of any new development would be entirely reliant on private vehicles, further exacerbating local traffic issues.

The local infrastructure is already under considerable strain. There are vague promises regarding school provision—land has been allocated but without any financial commitment to construct necessary facilities estimated at £10-15 million. Highway capacity upgrades are similarly unfunded beyond nominal contributions. Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements are planned off-site without enforceable long-term management agreements. Moreover, claims regarding 50% affordable housing lack clear viability evidence.

This location is unsuitable for additional development given existing pressures on community services; my GP surgery on Church Road struggles with appointment availability, while Forest Hall School frequently turns away local children due to oversubscription. Traffic congestion along B1383 during peak hours leads to significant delays, and current drainage systems are already insufficiently equipped for existing developments.

Given these concerns, I urge you to refuse this application as it poses substantial risks to our community's character, infrastructure capacity, and environmental integrity.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in our village for 16 years, I have a strong appreciation for the vital role this area plays in maintaining the essential gap between settlements. The land in question is crucial in preserving the historical setting of the medieval church and preventing coalescence with Bishop's Stortford, thus fulfilling several key Green Belt purposes. Development here would irreparably harm both the spatial and visual openness that has characterized this landscape for over a millennium.

The location is inherently unsuitable for development due to its reliance on car transportation. The site is situated 2.1 km from the nearest station without a continuous footway, presenting safety concerns with its unlit sections and steep gradients. Public transport options are limited, with bus services ceasing early and unavailable on Sundays. Local amenities are 1.8 km away, reinforcing car dependency and failing fundamental sustainability tests.

Additionally, there are significant issues with local infrastructure that remain unresolved in this proposal. The promise of a new school is misleadingly labeled as "land only," lacking any substantive commitment to fund the necessary £10-15 million for construction. Highway capacity improvements are similarly unfunded, mentioned merely as "contributions" without assurance of implementation. Biodiversity net gain is promised off-site, yet lacks enforceable long-term management guarantees. Furthermore, claims regarding affordable housing viability at 50% remain unsupported by evidence.

In my experience living here, Forest Hall School's oversubscription already denies local children places while forcing older students to travel further afield for sixth form education in Bishop's Stortford. GP surgeries are overwhelmed, resulting in unacceptable three-week waits for appointments. Moreover, road congestion during rush hours highlights existing gridlock issues that would be exacerbated by further development.

Given these substantial concerns related to heritage preservation, transportation inadequacies, infrastructure shortcomings, and unsustainable dependencies on cars, I urge you to refuse this application outright.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident of this area for over 25 years, I have observed firsthand the significant role this land plays in preventing urban sprawl between Birchanger, Stansted, and Bishop's Stortford. The preservation of the medieval church's rural character is vital, maintaining a historical continuity that dates back to the Domesday Book. The development would adversely impact both the spatial and visual openness that are central to its strong Green Belt function.

In terms of location and transportation, the site is poorly positioned for sustainable travel. It lies 2.1 kilometers from Stansted station, far exceeding the Department for Transport’s recommended walkability standard of 800 meters without a continuous footway. Furthermore, public transport options are insufficient; Bus 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday with no Sunday service, effectively necessitating car-dependency and potentially generating approximately 1,180 additional car trips daily. This situation contradicts principles of sustainable development.

The proposal also raises concerns regarding infrastructure inadequacies. The claim of providing affordable housing at a viability rate of 50% lacks substantiation. The commitment towards educational infrastructure appears hollow; offering land for a school does not address the substantial financial burden of construction estimated at over £10 million. Additionally, specific commitments to necessary highway upgrades are absent, as are secure Section 106 agreements ensuring these obligations are fulfilled prior to any occupation.

This location is unsuitable for further development based on current local conditions. Forest Hall School is already unable to accommodate all local children due to oversubscription, while GP surgeries struggle with capacity issues leading to unacceptable delays in patient care access. Traffic congestion is an everyday challenge with frequent gridlock on main routes exacerbating existing issues. Moreover, drainage systems are inadequate as evidenced by regular flooding events.

Given these significant concerns related to Green Belt purposes, transport connectivity, and strained local infrastructure services, I strongly urge refusal of this application in order to preserve our community’s heritage and ensure sustainable future growth.

I am writing to formally object to the planning application for development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident of this area for 24 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this site fulfills multiple essential purposes of the Green Belt. It effectively prevents the coalescence of our historic villages and safeguards the setting of our 12th-century church. Furthermore, it maintains the essential gap around Bishop's Stortford. Development on this site would compromise all these critical functions, thereby breaching its intended purposes.

The proposed development is fundamentally unsuitable due to its reliance on car transportation. The distance to Stansted station is 2.1 kilometers along roads lacking footways, which fails to meet acceptable accessibility standards. Additionally, the existing bus service (route 308) operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday and offers no evening or Sunday service, rendering public transport insufficient and unsustainable in accordance with NPPF Paragraph 155.

Concerns regarding infrastructure are also significant. The proposal lacks an open-book viability assessment to substantiate claims that 50% affordable housing is deliverable. While there is talk of offering land for a new school, there is no binding commitment to fund construction. Highway upgrades are mentioned merely as potential contributions with no secured funding or enforceable conditions. Moreover, Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) promises are off-site and carry delivery risks without legal security prior to occupation.

School capacity issues exacerbate the situation further; Forest Hall school is already oversubscribed, forcing children to travel considerable distances for education. Local healthcare services are equally strained, as evidenced by weeks-long waits for GP appointments at both local surgeries. Furthermore, traffic congestion during peak hours on all main roads remains problematic, while Birchanger Lane continues to suffer flooding after heavy rainfall events.

Given these substantive concerns regarding sustainability, infrastructure inadequacies, and irreversible harm to Green Belt principles, I urge you to refuse this planning application in favor of preserving our community’s integrity and character.

I am writing to object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

As a resident of this community for over 25 years, I have seen firsthand how this land plays a crucial role in maintaining the separation between the two medieval settlements it borders. It also safeguards the setting of a nationally recognized heritage asset, and acts as an essential buffer to prevent urban sprawl along the M11 corridor. The development would irreparably harm both spatial and visual openness, which are key purposes of the Green Belt designation.

The location is poorly suited for development due to its reliance on private car transport. The nearest train station is 2.1 kilometers away and lacks continuous footpaths, with significant gradients and unlit sections making pedestrian access impractical. Bus service 308 offers limited connectivity, running only hourly from Monday to Saturday with no service on Sundays, further emphasizing the site's unsustainable nature. Local shops are nearly 1.8 kilometers away, making daily errands car-dependent.

Furthermore, I have serious concerns regarding local infrastructure's capacity to support such development. Affordable housing viability at a proposed 50% remains unproven. Commitments toward school expansions currently address only land provision without guaranteeing construction funding—leaving questions about who bears these costs unanswered. Highway contributions lack clarity and appear unfunded, while biodiversity net gain (BNG) promises rely on off-site delivery without legally binding Section 106 agreements ensuring enforcement.

Additionally, existing services are already stretched beyond capacity. My GP surgery on Church Road struggles with appointment availability, and Forest Hall School has turned away local children due to oversubscription. Traffic congestion on B1383 is severe during peak hours, and current drainage systems are inadequate even without additional strain from new developments.

Given these substantial concerns related to sustainability, infrastructure provision, and protection of our valuable Green Belt resources, I urge you to refuse this application.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having been a resident of this area for 13 years, I have witnessed firsthand the essential role this land plays in maintaining the separation between Birchanger and Stansted, with only a narrow gap of 1.2km currently existing. The open countryside is vital not only for preventing coalescence but also for preserving the setting of our medieval church. Any development here would compromise these important Green Belt purposes and breach the Bishop's Stortford gap.

The site is unsuitable for development due to its car-dependent nature. Walking to Stansted station involves a 2.1km journey along the B1383, which lacks footways, making it unsafe for pedestrians. Public transport options are inadequate, as Bus 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday, with no service after 6:30pm or on Sundays. Additionally, the nearest shops are located 1.8km away, failing to meet Department for Transport walkability standards and National Planning Policy Framework sustainability tests.

Infrastructure concerns compound these issues further. The promise of a new school is misleading; while land has been earmarked, there is no financial provision for building construction—leaving a critical gap in educational infrastructure funding. GP surgeries already struggle with capacity, leading to appointment delays of up to three weeks. Traffic congestion on Cambridge Road exacerbates daily commuting problems as it remains gridlocked during peak hours. Furthermore, local flooding incidents have been increasing annually without adequate mitigation measures in place.

Promises related to highway improvements and biodiversity net gain lack concrete financial commitments and enforceable management plans, rendering them ineffective assurances rather than actionable solutions.

In light of these serious deficiencies across transport, infrastructure, and heritage preservation considerations—coupled with adverse impacts on Green Belt integrity���I urge you to refuse this planning application outright.

No commitments are tied to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity crisis - Forest Hall is full, children being sent to schools miles away. GP surgery appointments take 2-3 weeks to get. Traffic on Cambridge Road is gridlocked morning and evening. Local flooding gets worse every year.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in the village for 16 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this land plays in preserving the separation between Birchanger and Stansted. The current gap of merely 1.2 kilometers is already minimal, and any development here would risk coalescence, undermining a key purpose of the Green Belt. Furthermore, the open countryside setting is vital to maintaining the historic character of our medieval church, while also safeguarding the Bishop's Stortford gap from encroachment.

Regarding location and transport issues, it is evident that this site is not suitable due to its reliance on private vehicles. The distance of 2.1 kilometers from the nearest station lacks a continuous safe walking route, contravening Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) which emphasizes accessible locations. Public transport options are severely limited, with only hourly weekday buses and no services available in evenings or on Sundays.

The claimed benefits of this proposal appear unsubstantiated. The developer’s offer of school land lacks accompanying commitments for funding buildings or operational costs such as equipment and staffing. Additionally, highway mitigation proposals remain vague with non-specific s106 contributions lacking definitive amounts or implementation timelines. Biodiversity net gain (BNG) plans also fall short by relying on off-site units without a secured 30-year management plan.

In terms of local infrastructure inadequacies, there is an ongoing school capacity crisis; Forest Hall cannot accommodate additional students, necessitating long commutes for children to distant schools. GP surgery appointments are delayed by weeks, and traffic congestion along Cambridge Road during peak times has become untenable. Annual flooding further exacerbates these challenges.

Given these significant concerns regarding Green Belt impacts, transportation accessibility failures, and infrastructure inadequacies, I urge you to refuse this application. It poses substantial harm to both our community's character and quality of life without delivering assured benefits.

Thank you for considering my objections grounded in genuine observations over years residing in this area.

## Objection 33

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived here for 8 years with my family

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement coalescence, safeguarding heritage asset settings, maintaining strategic gaps. NPPF paragraph 138 purposes are clearly met.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no safe walking route to the station 2.1km away - no footways, steep hills, unlit. The bus runs once per hour weekdays, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. This is fundamentally unsustainable and car-dependent.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School commitment is LAND ONLY - where is the £10-15 million needed for buildings? Highway capacity upgrades are unfunded "contributions". BNG is off-site without enforceable 30-year management. Affordable housing viability at 50% is not evidenced. These are vague promises.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare overwhelmed - my GP has 3-week appointment waits. Schools at capacity - Forest Hall rejected local applications. Traffic gridlocked on B1383 and Cambridge Road every rush hour. Flooding occurs regularly making lanes impassable.

I am writing to express my strong objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land, where I have lived with my family for the past eight years.

This land fulfills several critical Green Belt functions as outlined in paragraph 138 of the National Planning Policy Framework. It plays a vital role in preventing settlement coalescence, safeguarding the settings of heritage assets, and maintaining strategic gaps within our area. The proposed development would irrevocably harm both the spatial and visual openness these purposes are meant to protect.

The location is fundamentally unsuitable for development due to its car-dependent nature. There is no safe pedestrian route to the station 2.1 kilometers away, as there are no footways, steep hills, and inadequate street lighting. Public transport options are severely limited, with only an hourly bus service on weekdays that ceases by 6:30 p.m., and no service on Sundays. The lack of adequate walking or cycling infrastructure further exacerbates this issue, making any claimed sustainability benefits questionable at best.

Regarding local infrastructure concerns, the proposal lacks clarity and evidence of deliverability. The commitment to providing school facilities is limited to land allocation without securing the necessary £10-15 million funding for constructing buildings. Similarly, highway capacity upgrades depend on unfunded "contributions," while Biodiversity Net Gain proposals are off-site with no enforceable 30-year management plan in place. Furthermore, the claim of a 50% affordable housing viability lacks supporting evidence.

The unsuitability of this site for development is compounded by existing strains on local services. Healthcare facilities are overwhelmed; it takes three weeks to secure an appointment with my GP. Schools have reached capacity; Forest Hall has already rejected local applications due to overcrowding. Traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road during rush hours creates gridlock conditions regularly, and recurrent flooding renders local lanes impassable.

In light of these significant concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, transport sustainability, infrastructure inadequacies, and service overloads, I urge you to refuse this application in order to preserve the character and functionality of our community.

## Objection 34

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived locally for 17 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt maintains the essential gap between villages, protects the 12th-century church countryside setting, and prevents Bishop's Stortford merger. Development would undermine all three fundamental purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to Stansted station is 2.1km on roads without footways, failing accessibility standards. The bus service (route 308) is hourly Mon-Sat only, no evening or Sunday service. This location fails NPPF Para 155 sustainability test.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer offers school land but no commitment to fund construction, fit-out, or staffing. Highway mitigation lacks specific financial commitments or delivery timelines. BNG dependent on off-site units. 50% affordable housing lacks open-book viability assessment proving deliverability.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP practice (Lower Street) has 3-week wait times. Forest Hall School rejected my child due to oversubscription. Traffic gridlock on B1383 and Cambridge Road is daily occurrence. Surface water flooding gets worse with each new development.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having lived in the local community for 17 years, I am deeply concerned about the implications of this proposal.

The land fulfills critical Green Belt functions by maintaining a necessary buffer between our villages, preserving the countryside setting of the historic 12th-century church, and preventing urban sprawl that could lead to a merger with Bishop's Stortford. The development would severely compromise these essential Green Belt purposes, diminishing both spatial and visual openness.

In terms of location and transport, the proposed site is predominantly car-dependent due to inadequate public transport links and insufficient pedestrian pathways. Walking to Stansted station involves navigating 2.1km on roads that lack footways, which fails to meet accessibility standards. The current bus service is limited, with route 308 offering only an hourly service from Monday to Saturday and no provision for evenings or Sundays. This situation does not satisfy the sustainability criteria outlined in Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework.

Furthermore, I have observed significant issues with local infrastructure that cast doubt on the feasibility of this development. Although there is an offer of school land by the developer, there is no clear commitment regarding construction funding or staffing provisions. Additionally, highway mitigation measures lack specific financial backing and timelines for execution. Biodiversity Net Gain appears reliant on off-site units without concrete plans in place. The proposal includes a promise of 50% affordable housing; however, there is no open-book viability assessment provided to ensure its deliverability.

Moreover, my personal experience underscores why this location is unsuitable for further development. Current infrastructure strains are evident with my GP practice facing three-week wait times and Forest Hall School being oversubscribed, resulting in refusal of admission for my child. Traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road is a daily issue exacerbated by surface water flooding which worsens with each new development.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, transport inadequacies, and stretched local services, I urge you to refuse this application.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Resident for 13 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This site serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement merger, protecting the historic church setting that dates to the 12th century, and maintaining the Bishop's Stortford separation gap. Without this land, continuous urban sprawl would result.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The location is 2.1km from public transport with no safe pedestrian route. Bus service is minimal - hourly on weekdays only, stops at 6:30pm. This forces car-ownership and fails to meet sustainable location criteria.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School expansion: land offered but who funds the £10-15 million buildings? Highway mitigation is vague "s106 contribution" without amounts or timelines. BNG off-site creates delivery uncertainty. Affordable housing at 50% lacks economic viability evidence.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity crisis - Forest Hall full, no local provision. Healthcare access dire - GP surgeries overwhelmed with 3-week waits. Road infrastructure at breaking point - gridlock morning and evening. Flooding on Birchanger Lane regularly.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having lived in this area for 13 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this site plays in maintaining our community's character and integrity.

The preservation of Green Belt purposes here is paramount. This land acts as a vital buffer, preventing the merger of settlements and protecting the historic setting of our 12th-century church. It also preserves the separation gap necessary for maintaining Bishop’s Stortford’s distinctiveness, without which we risk continuous urban sprawl.

From a transport perspective, the location is clearly unsuitable as it is situated 2.1 kilometers from any public transport link, with no safe pedestrian access. The minimal bus service only runs hourly on weekdays and ceases at 6:30 pm, making car ownership a necessity rather than a choice. This reliance on cars contradicts sustainable development principles.

Furthermore, there are significant concerns about local infrastructure and services that remain unaddressed. Although there is mention of school expansion, there is no clarity on funding for required buildings estimated at £10-15 million. Highway improvements are vaguely referenced through s106 contributions without specified amounts or timelines. Additionally, the reliance on off-site Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) raises questions about delivery certainty.

The suitability of this location for development is further undermined by existing pressures on community resources. Forest Hall School is operating at full capacity with no local alternatives available. Healthcare facilities are overburdened, evidenced by GP surgeries with three-week waiting times. The road network endures severe congestion during peak hours, and regular flooding occurs on Birchanger Lane.

Given these substantial issues concerning transport accessibility, local infrastructure strain, and the irreplaceable functions served by this Green Belt land, I strongly urge that this application be refused to protect both our heritage and quality of life in the area.

## Objection 36

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been in Birchanger for 9 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt stops Birchanger and Stansted becoming indistinguishable suburbs. The historic church would lose its rural setting. The gap to Bishop's Stortford is already minimal and would be eliminated. Strong Green Belt contribution.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from public transport with dangerous pedestrian access (no footway, gradient, unlit). Bus service inadequate - hourly weekdays only. This location is car-dependent with estimated 1,180 daily car trips, failing NPPF Para 155.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer promises school land but no funded buildings, highway contributions without binding amounts, BNG off-site with no management plan, 50% affordable without viability proof. These are unenforceable promises, not legally secured commitments.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is full - children being sent to distant schools. GP appointment waits are 3 weeks at local surgeries. B1383 and Cambridge Road gridlocked morning and evening. Birchanger Lane floods regularly after heavy rainfall.

I am writing to object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land in our village of Birchanger. 

Having lived here for nine years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this area plays in maintaining a clear separation between Birchanger and Stansted, preserving our identity as distinct communities rather than merging into indistinguishable suburbs. This land contributes significantly to the Green Belt purposes by maintaining spatial openness and safeguarding our historic church's rural setting.

The location and transport situation further underscore the unsuitability of this proposal. The site lies 2.1 kilometers from any public transport facilities, with pedestrian access being perilous due to the absence of footways, steep gradients, and lack of lighting. The current bus service is insufficient, operating only hourly on weekdays. Such conditions contravene the requirements set out in NPPF Paragraph 155 regarding sustainable transport options, rendering the development heavily car-dependent with an estimated increase of 1,180 daily car trips.

Furthermore, there are substantial concerns regarding infrastructure promises made by the developer that lack enforceability and clarity. While there are claims about contributing land for educational purposes and highway improvements, these commitments remain vague without specified funding or binding agreements. Likewise, biodiversity net gain plans are off-site without a clear management strategy, and assertions of providing 50% affordable housing lack viability evidence.

Existing local infrastructure is already under strain; Forest Hall School has reached capacity, forcing families to seek education further afield. GP surgeries report wait times extending up to three weeks for appointments. Additionally, traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road during peak hours is severe, and frequent flooding issues along Birchanger Lane exacerbate these challenges.

In light of these considerations—impact on Green Belt integrity, inadequate transport links, unenforceable infrastructure proposals, and existing community pressures—I urge you to refuse this application. Our community's character and sustainability depend on such decisions being made with careful regard for these critical factors.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land in Birchanger, where I have resided for the past 20 years.

The land in question plays a critical role in preserving the essential gap between our village and neighboring areas. It safeguards the rural setting of our 12th-century church and prevents the merger with Bishop's Stortford, serving fundamental Green Belt purposes that this proposal would irreparably damage.

From a transport perspective, the site is poorly situated for development. The distance to the nearest station is 2.1 kilometers along the B1383, which lacks a footway, presents a steep gradient, and has no lighting. The current bus service operates on an hourly schedule during weekdays, failing to support daily commuting needs or meet sustainability benchmarks for accessible locations.

There are significant concerns regarding local infrastructure and services as well. The viability of affordable housing at a proposed rate of 50% remains unsubstantiated. While there is mention of land allocation for a new school, there is no clear strategy or financial commitment to fund its construction—an undertaking likely exceeding £10 million. Highway upgrades necessary to support increased traffic lack specific commitments, and biodiversity net gain targets are dependent on off-site delivery without assured outcomes.

Furthermore, this location is unsuitable for development given existing pressures on local amenities. Forest Hall School is currently at capacity, resulting in local children being unable to secure places. GP surgeries are similarly oversubscribed, with patients facing weeks-long waits for appointments. Traffic congestion during peak hours already causes gridlock on all major routes, and frequent flooding highlights inadequacies in our drainage system.

Given these considerations—the threat to Green Belt integrity, insufficient transport and infrastructure provisions, and overwhelming pressure on public services—I urge you to refuse this planning application in order to preserve both our community's character and quality of life.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on the Green Belt land between Birchanger and Stansted. Having been a resident in this area for over 25 years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this land plays in maintaining the distinct identities of our communities.

The development poses a significant threat to the Green Belt purposes, particularly in preventing coalescence between Birchanger and Stansted. This area acts as a crucial barrier, preserving the strategic separation from Bishop's Stortford and safeguarding heritage assets such as our 12th-century church. Any intrusion into this land would irreparably harm both its spatial and visual openness, altering the character of our local environment.

From a transport perspective, the site is fundamentally car-dependent due to inadequate public transport options and non-existent pedestrian infrastructure. The nearest station is 2.1 km away with no safe footway access, compounded by steep hills. Additionally, the bus service is infrequent, running just once an hour on weekdays with no Sunday service and ending at 6:30 pm. This lack of sustainable transport options makes reliance on private vehicles inevitable.

Critical concerns also arise regarding infrastructure promises made by the developer. While there is mention of offering school land, there are no commitments towards construction funding or staff provision. Similarly, highway mitigation lacks definitive financial backing or timelines for delivery. The proposal's dependency on off-site biodiversity net gains further undermines its environmental credentials. Moreover, claims of providing 50% affordable housing remain unsupported by an open-book viability assessment to guarantee deliverability.

The location is unsuitable for such development given existing infrastructural challenges: local schools are oversubscribed with children sent miles away for education; GP appointments entail waits of 2-3 weeks; traffic congestion on B1383 during rush hour is severe; and frequent flooding occurs along Birchanger Lane after heavy rains.

In light of these substantial issues concerning Green Belt integrity, transport sustainability, and inadequate infrastructure assurances, I urge you to refuse this application for the continued wellbeing of our community.

Having lived here for 12 years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this land plays in maintaining the separation between Birchanger and Stansted. At just 1.2km apart, any development would compromise this narrow gap, threatening coalescence and detracting from the historical setting of our medieval church, which relies significantly on its surrounding open countryside. Furthermore, breaching the Bishop's Stortford gap would irreparably alter the area's character.

The site in question is unsuitable for development primarily due to its reliance on car travel. With no walkable access to the train station—2.1km away without a footway and featuring steep hills—the location inherently promotes car dependency. Additionally, public transport options are inadequate; bus services run only once an hour on weekdays with no service on Sundays and end as early as 6:30 pm. This clearly highlights a lack of sustainable transport solutions.

There are also significant concerns regarding local infrastructure commitments that appear unfulfilled or inadequately addressed. The commitment to provide school facilities is limited merely to land allocation without funding for construction, leaving questions about where necessary financial resources will come from. Local GP surgeries are already oversubscribed, leading to unacceptable waiting times for appointments. Moreover, proposed highway mitigations lack concrete funding guarantees, making traffic congestion during peak hours a persistent issue. The drainage system already struggles with repeated flooding incidents, highlighting further infrastructural inadequacies.

Lastly, biodiversity net gain (BNG) measures are relegated off-site with no enforceable management plan in place, raising doubts about their effectiveness and sustainability.

Given these considerations—ranging from Green Belt harm to unsustainable transport and insufficient infrastructure—I urge you to refuse this planning application in order to preserve the integrity of our community and environment.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed planning application for development on this Green Belt land. Having resided in this area for 17 years, I am deeply concerned about the profound impact such a development would have on our community.

The land in question fulfills critical Green Belt purposes as outlined in NPPF paragraph 138. Its development would lead to the coalescence of settlements, thereby eliminating the essential gap that currently maintains the historic character and setting of our local church. Furthermore, this proposal threatens to breach the separation between Bishop's Stortford and surrounding areas, undermining both spatial and visual openness that is vital to preserving our local heritage and character.

In terms of location and transport infrastructure, the site is inherently unsustainable. With no walkable path to the train station—2.1 kilometers away without a footway and over steep terrain—the area is fundamentally car-dependent. The limited bus service, which runs only hourly on weekdays with no Sunday service and concludes by 6:30 PM, exacerbates this issue, making it impractical for residents relying on public transportation.

The promises made under what are termed the "Golden Rules" are also concerning due to their lack of deliverability. There are significant doubts regarding funding for essential infrastructure such as schools, where over £10 million would be required without identified sources. Highway mitigation lacks enforceable commitments, while Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) measures are off-site with delivery uncertainties. Additionally, there is no evidence supporting the viability of affordable housing proposals or enforceable Section 106 agreements ensuring their delivery.

Moreover, from my personal experience within this community, I can attest to existing strains on local services. Our healthcare facilities are already in crisis; securing an appointment at my GP surgery involves a three-week wait. Educational capacities have been reached with Forest Hall School being full and lacking sixth form provisions. The road network suffers from severe congestion during peak times along B1383 and Cambridge Road. Flooding issues further complicate matters by frequently affecting local lanes.

Given these substantial concerns regarding Green Belt integrity, infrastructure inadequacies, and unsustainable transport options, I urge you to refuse this application in order to preserve both our environment and community wellbeing.

Having lived in this area for 23 years, I have witnessed firsthand the significant role this land plays in maintaining the distinct identities of two ancient villages and protecting the setting of a 12th-century Grade I listed church. The proposal undermines these crucial Green Belt purposes by threatening both spatial and visual openness, which has long preserved our local heritage and prevented urban sprawl from merging with Bishop's Stortford.

The location is inherently unsuitable for development due to its high dependency on car travel. The nearest station is 2.1 kilometers away via the B1383, a road lacking footpaths and street lighting, with a steep gradient that poses safety concerns. Public transport options are limited, given that bus route 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday, ceasing services at 6:30 pm. This situation fails to meet the sustainability standards outlined in Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), as it does not promote sustainable transport solutions.

Furthermore, existing infrastructure is already under significant strain. Forest Hall School has reached capacity, resulting in local children being turned away. Similarly, GP services at Lower Street surgery are stretched thin with wait times extending up to three weeks for an appointment. Traffic congestion along B1383 and Cambridge Road during peak hours further exacerbates accessibility issues while Birchanger Lane frequently becomes impassable due to flooding after heavy rain.

The developer's claims regarding community benefits are unsubstantiated and lack enforceable guarantees. The assertion of providing 50% affordable housing lacks economic viability evidence; similarly, promises regarding school infrastructure are limited merely to land allocation without funding commitments for construction. Additionally, highway improvements lack binding financial assurances, and biodiversity net gain relies on off-site compensation without a secured 30-year management plan.

For these reasons, I urge you to refuse this planning application. The proposal not only compromises essential Green Belt functions but also places undue pressure on our community’s already overstretched infrastructure and services. Thank you for considering my representation grounded in extensive local knowledge and experience.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in this area for 23 years, I am acutely aware of the vital role this land plays in maintaining the essential separation between our villages. It serves a critical function in preserving the setting of our 12th-century church and preventing the merger with Bishop's Stortford. The introduction of development in this location would fundamentally undermine these Green Belt purposes, eroding both its spatial and visual openness.

The site's suitability is further compromised by its poor transport links. Situated 2.1 kilometers from the nearest station, there is no continuous safe walking route available. The public transport offering is limited to hourly bus services that run only on weekdays and do not operate during evenings or Sundays. This lack of accessible transport options fails to meet the requirements outlined in Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).

The local infrastructure already exhibits significant strain. Forest Hall School is turning away local children due to oversubscription, GP surgeries are operating at full capacity making timely appointments unattainable, and daily gridlock affects the main routes due to inadequate traffic infrastructure. Moreover, drainage systems are insufficient, leading to frequent flooding issues.

Furthermore, several key promises related to infrastructure improvements remain unsubstantiated or unsecured through legally enforceable mechanisms such as Section 106 agreements. The viability of affordable housing at a promised rate of 50% remains unproven. The commitment regarding school expansion only refers to land provision without addressing who will bear construction costs. Highway contributions lack clarity and funding assurance, while off-site Biodiversity Net Gain proposals create uncertainty about delivery.

Given these substantial concerns, I urge you to refuse this planning application. The adverse impacts on our community's character and functionality far outweigh any perceived benefits of the proposed development.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living here for the past 11 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The gap between settlements would be eliminated, causing coalescence. The historic church setting relies on open countryside. Bishop's Stortford separation would be breached. This land strongly serves Green Belt purposes under NPPF paragraph 138.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to the station is 2.1km with no safe footway, steep gradients, and unlit sections. Public transport is inadequate - hourly buses weekdays only, no evening or Sunday service. Residents would be entirely car-dependent.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School infrastructure: developer offers land but no funded buildings - this is meaningless without committed funding. Highway upgrades are unfunded. Affordable housing at 50% lacks viability assessment. BNG is off-site with delivery risk. No legal commitments securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare crisis - my GP surgery has 3-week appointment waits. School capacity exhausted - Forest Hall full, no sixth form. Road network gridlocked every rush hour on B1383 and Cambridge Road. Flooding occurs regularly on local lanes.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land, where I have resided for the past 11 years. The proposal poses significant threats to the core purposes served by the Green Belt, as outlined in paragraph 138 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). Allowing this development would eliminate the vital gap between settlements, leading to coalescence and compromising the historical integrity of the church setting reliant on open countryside. Furthermore, it would breach the separation from Bishop's Stortford, critically undermining both spatial and visual openness.

The location's transport infrastructure is unsuitable for such development. Residents face a 2.1km walk to the nearest station under unsafe conditions due to steep gradients, unlit sections, and absence of footways. The limited public transport options—hourly weekday buses with no evening or Sunday service—render residents heavily dependent on cars. This situation contradicts sustainable development principles and exacerbates traffic congestion issues already plaguing roads like B1383 and Cambridge Road.

Infrastructure promises tied to this development lack substantive commitment and feasibility. The offer of land for school use is ineffective without dedicated funding for building facilities. Proposed highway improvements similarly remain unfunded, casting doubt on their delivery. Additionally, while affordable housing is promised at 50%, there is no viability assessment ensuring its practicality. Biodiversity net gain is planned off-site with significant delivery risks, and there are no legal guarantees securing these benefits before occupancy begins.

The local healthcare system cannot support further population growth; my experience includes enduring three-week waits for GP appointments. School capacity has reached its limit—with Forest Hall full and lacking a sixth form—further straining an overstretched community resource.

Given these considerations, I urge you to refuse this planning application due to its adverse impacts on our community’s character, infrastructure, and sustainability objectives.

## Objection 44

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been a local resident for over 25 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This land performs multiple Green Belt purposes simultaneously: prevents merging of settlements, safeguards the Grade I listed St Mary's Church historic setting, maintains the strategic gap to Bishop's Stortford preventing regional sprawl.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is 2.1km from Stansted station with NO continuous footway, failing the DfT 800m walkability standard. Bus 308 runs hourly Mon-Sat only, last bus at 6:30pm, NO Sunday service. This forces car-dependency with an estimated 1,180 daily car trips.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
School infrastructure: developer offers land but no funded buildings - this is meaningless without committed funding. Highway upgrades are unfunded. Affordable housing at 50% lacks viability assessment. BNG is off-site with delivery risk. No legal commitments securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School places are unavailable - Forest Hall oversubscribed, children traveling miles. GP appointments take weeks to get at both local surgeries. Morning and evening traffic is gridlocked on all main roads. Flooding on Birchanger Lane after heavy rain.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land, where I have been a local resident for over 25 years. The proposal raises several significant concerns regarding its impact on both the community and environment.

This land serves vital Green Belt purposes, effectively preventing the merging of settlements and maintaining a strategic gap to Bishop's Stortford, thereby averting regional sprawl. Additionally, it safeguards the historic setting of the Grade I listed St Mary's Church. Any development on this site would irreversibly harm its spatial and visual openness, contravening the principles set out for protected areas.

The location is poorly suited for development due to inadequate transport infrastructure. The site is 2.1 kilometers from Stansted station without a continuous footway, which clearly fails to meet the Department for Transport's 800-meter walkability standard. Public transportation options are insufficient; Bus 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday, with no service after 6:30 pm or on Sundays. This lack of connectivity will inevitably lead to car dependency, generating approximately 1,180 additional daily car trips and exacerbating congestion.

Furthermore, local infrastructure is already stretched beyond capacity. Schools such as Forest Hall are oversubscribed, forcing children to travel long distances for education. Offers by developers to provide land for schools are undermined by the lack of committed funding for necessary buildings. Similarly, highway upgrades remain unfunded, and affordable housing lacks a viability assessment. Biodiversity net gain proposals rely on off-site measures with significant delivery risks due to absent legal commitments securing implementation prior to occupation.

Existing services such as healthcare also face considerable strain; obtaining an appointment at either local GP surgery currently takes weeks. Traffic issues persist during peak hours as main roads become gridlocked, and frequent flooding occurs along Birchanger Lane following heavy rainfall.

Given these substantial concerns relating to transport inadequacies, overstretched services, and critical Green Belt purposes served by this land, I respectfully urge you to refuse this planning application.

## Objection 45

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Lived in the village for 16 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt maintains the essential gap between villages, protects the 12th-century church countryside setting, and prevents Bishop's Stortford merger. Development would undermine all three fundamental purposes.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
Walking to Stansted station is 2.1km via the B1383 without footways. Bus 308: hourly Mon-Sat, last bus 6:30pm, no Sundays. Nearest shops 1.8km. This is a car-dependent location failing DfT walkability standards and NPPF sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The school offer is land only - no funding commitment for buildings, staffing, or equipment. Highway upgrades are listed as s106 "contributions" without specific amounts or triggers. BNG relies on off-site units. Affordable housing at 50% has no viability evidence. No binding legal agreements.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
School capacity crisis - Forest Hall is full, children being sent to schools miles away. GP surgery appointments take 2-3 weeks to get. Traffic on Cambridge Road is gridlocked morning and evening. Local flooding gets worse every year.

I am writing to express my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land in our village, where I have resided for 16 years.

This land serves critical Green Belt purposes by preserving the essential separation between villages and protecting the historical setting of our 12th-century church. It also prevents the merging of our community with Bishop's Stortford. The proposed development threatens these fundamental objectives, compromising both the spatial and visual openness that characterizes our area.

In terms of location and transport, this proposal is unsustainable. The site is heavily reliant on car travel due to inadequate public transportation options and poor pedestrian infrastructure. Walking to Stansted station involves a 2.1 km journey along the B1383, which lacks footways, while Bus 308 operates only hourly from Monday to Saturday with no service on Sundays. Additionally, the nearest shops are 1.8 km away, making it difficult for residents to access basic amenities without a vehicle. This fails both Department for Transport walkability standards and National Planning Policy Framework sustainability tests.

The proposal also raises significant concerns regarding local infrastructure capacity and provision of services. There is a current crisis in school capacity; Forest Hall is at full capacity, forcing children to attend schools far from home. The GP surgery struggles with wait times of two to three weeks for appointments. Moreover, existing road networks are already experiencing severe congestion during peak hours on Cambridge Road. Flooding issues are worsening annually, yet there are no concrete plans or commitments for necessary improvements or new facilities.

Finally, many promises associated with this development lack enforcement mechanisms or clear evidence of feasibility. The educational offer comprises merely a land allocation without any financial commitment towards buildings or staffing needs. Highway upgrades appear as vague Section 106 contributions lacking specificity in amounts or implementation triggers. Biodiversity Net Gain depends on off-site units rather than onsite enhancements, and claims of providing 50% affordable housing remain unsubstantiated by viability studies or binding legal agreements.

Given these substantial concerns, I urge you to refuse this application in order to safeguard our community’s heritage and uphold planning principles effectively.

## Objection 46

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been here for 22 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This site serves critical Green Belt functions: preventing settlement merger, protecting the historic church setting that dates to the 12th century, and maintaining the Bishop's Stortford separation gap. Without this land, continuous urban sprawl would result.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The location is 2.1km from public transport with no safe pedestrian route. Bus service is minimal - hourly on weekdays only, stops at 6:30pm. This forces car-ownership and fails to meet sustainable location criteria.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing viability at 50% is unproven. School commitment is land only - construction funding unaddressed (£10m+ cost). Highway upgrades lack specific commitments. BNG dependent on off-site delivery. No Section 106 agreements securing delivery before occupation.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP practice (Lower Street) has 3-week wait times. Forest Hall School rejected my child due to oversubscription. Traffic gridlock on B1383 and Cambridge Road is daily occurrence. Surface water flooding gets worse with each new development.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having resided in this area for 22 years, I have witnessed firsthand the vital role this land plays in maintaining our community's character and heritage. The site serves critical functions in preventing the merger of settlements, protecting the historic setting of our 12th-century church, and preserving the separation gap between Bishop's Stortford and surrounding areas. Allowing development here would lead to irreversible urban sprawl.

The location is ill-suited for such development due to its reliance on private vehicles. The nearest public transport is a considerable distance at 2.1 kilometers away, with no safe pedestrian paths available, making public transport inaccessible for many. Moreover, the existing bus service is minimal, operating only hourly on weekdays and ceasing by early evening. This situation fails to meet sustainable transportation criteria and would exacerbate traffic congestion along already overburdened routes such as B1383 and Cambridge Road.

Furthermore, there are significant concerns regarding infrastructure capacity. Currently, my GP practice at Lower Street has unacceptably long waiting times of up to three weeks. Additionally, local schools are oversubscribed; my own child was unable to secure a place at Forest Hall School due to capacity issues. Promises of affordable housing lack viability evidence at 50%, and commitments for educational facilities are insufficiently funded, with construction costs exceeding £10 million not addressed.

Environmental considerations also remain unconvincing, with biodiversity net gain relying heavily on off-site measures rather than enhancing the immediate environment. No binding Section 106 agreements ensure these facilities or upgrades will be delivered before occupation begins.

In light of these issues — from transport inadequacies to unresolved infrastructure demands — it is clear that the proposal would seriously undermine both the character and functionality of our community. I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect our valued Green Belt land and ensure sustainable growth within our area.

I am writing to object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident in this area for the past 18 years, I have witnessed firsthand the critical role this site plays in maintaining the distinct identities of our two ancient villages and preserving the setting of our 12th-century Grade I listed church. The development threatens these important Green Belt purposes by eroding both spatial and visual openness that is essential to our local character.

The location and transport situation are fundamentally unsustainable. The absence of safe pedestrian routes to the station, which lies 2.1 kilometers away, combined with steep, unlit roads, highlights the car-dependent nature of this proposal. The limited bus service—running once per hour on weekdays and not at all on Sundays—does nothing to alleviate this dependency.

Further concerns arise from inadequacies in local infrastructure and services that remain unaddressed. The school provision is merely a promise of land without any financial commitment toward buildings, staffing, or necessary equipment. Similarly, highway upgrades are mentioned as s106 contributions but lack specificity regarding amounts or implementation triggers. The reliance on off-site units for Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) underscores an unsustainable environmental impact.

Additionally, the capacity constraints at Forest Hall School, where local children are already being denied places, and oversubscription issues at GP surgeries—with lengthy waiting times for appointments—exacerbate existing pressures on community resources. Traffic congestion during rush hours further underscores that current infrastructure cannot support additional strain.

The proposed development's failure to provide any binding legal agreements or clear evidence supporting its claimed benefits contravenes best planning practices and fails to address fundamental concerns regarding sustainability and community well-being.

In light of these substantial issues, I urge you to refuse this application in order to protect the integrity of our cherished Green Belt land and ensure sustainable development within our community.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Living here for the past 11 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
The land strongly prevents Birchanger-Stansted coalescence which would destroy both communities' distinct identities. It safeguards heritage assets including the 12th-century church. It maintains strategic separation from Bishop's Stortford.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The nearest station is 2.1km via the B1383 which has no footway, a 6% gradient, and no street lighting. Bus route 308 is hourly Monday-Saturday only, last bus 6:30pm. This location is car-dependent and fails NPPF Para 155 sustainability requirements.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The "Golden Rules" are undeliverable promises: school land without building funding (£10m+ required), highway mitigation without binding commitments, BNG off-site with delivery risk, affordable housing without viability evidence. No enforceable Section 106 securing delivery.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
My GP practice (Lower Street) has 3-week wait times. Forest Hall School rejected my child due to oversubscription. Traffic gridlock on B1383 and Cambridge Road is daily occurrence. Surface water flooding gets worse with each new development.

I am writing to register my objection to the proposed development on this Green Belt land. Having lived in this area for the past 11 years, I have observed firsthand the vital role that this land plays in preserving the distinct identities of Birchanger and Stansted. It serves as a crucial buffer that prevents these communities from merging, thus maintaining their unique characteristics and safeguarding heritage assets such as the 12th-century church. Furthermore, it ensures strategic separation from Bishop's Stortford, which is essential for maintaining local character.

The proposed site suffers from significant transportation challenges that underscore its unsuitability for development. The nearest train station is located 2.1 kilometers away via the B1383—a road that lacks pedestrian walkways, features a steep gradient, and is not equipped with street lighting. Public transport is also inadequate; bus route 308 operates only hourly and ceases service at 6:30 pm from Monday to Saturday. This renders the location heavily car-dependent and inconsistent with Paragraph 155 of the National Planning Policy Framework regarding sustainability.

Additionally, concerns about infrastructure and services are pressing. Promises made under so-called "Golden Rules" are unfulfilled: there are no secured funds for school construction, highway improvements lack binding commitments, biodiversity net gain relies on off-site measures with uncertain delivery, and affordable housing plans do not demonstrate viability. Critically, there is no enforceable Section 106 agreement to ensure these promises materialize.

The local infrastructure is already strained beyond capacity. My GP practice has waiting times exceeding three weeks, while my child was unable to secure a place at Forest Hall School due to oversubscription issues—problems exacerbated by daily traffic congestion on B1383 and Cambridge Road. Moreover, surface water flooding has intensified with each new development in our area.

Considering these factors—the harm to Green Belt purposes, inadequate transport links, undeliverable infrastructure promises, and existing pressures on services—I urge you to refuse this planning application.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been a resident for 19 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This land prevents Birchanger and Stansted from merging into one continuous urban sprawl. It safeguards the 12th-century St Mary's Church historic setting and maintains the crucial separation gap with Bishop's Stortford. These are CORE Green Belt functions under NPPF.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
The site is too far from the station (2.1km) with no safe walking route. Public transport is inadequate - one bus per hour Mon-Sat, none on Sundays, last bus 6:30pm. Residents would need cars for commuting, shopping, healthcare.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
The developer offers school LAND but not funded BUILDINGS - who pays for construction, equipment, and teachers? Highway mitigation is listed as vague "s106 contribution" without binding amounts or delivery triggers. BNG relies on off-site units with no 30-year management plan secured. No commitments are tied to occupation triggers.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Forest Hall School is full - local children being turned away. GP surgeries overwhelmed - weeks of wait for appointments. B1383 traffic is at capacity - gridlock daily during commute times. Existing drainage infrastructure cannot cope with current levels.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having lived in this area for 19 years, I have seen firsthand the vital role this land plays in maintaining the separation between Birchanger and Stansted, thereby preventing an unwanted urban sprawl. The presence of St Mary’s Church, dating back to the 12th century, further underscores the historic value that must be preserved. These functions align with core Green Belt purposes as delineated in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF).

The proposed site is ill-suited for development due to its dependence on cars. It is located 2.1 kilometers from the nearest station without a safe pedestrian route. Public transport options are severely limited, with a single hourly bus service that ceases by 6:30 pm and offers no services on Sundays. This lack of adequate transport infrastructure would necessitate increased car usage by residents, exacerbating existing traffic congestion on the B1383, which already experiences daily gridlock during peak hours.

Infrastructure concerns further question the viability of this proposal. While land for a school has been mentioned, there is no commitment from developers regarding funding for construction or operation. The vague mention of "s106 contributions" for highway improvements lacks specificity and enforceability regarding timing and amounts. Furthermore, biodiversity net gain relies on off-site units without any secured long-term management plan.

The strain on local services is also significant; Forest Hall School cannot accommodate more students, leading to local children being turned away. Similarly, GP surgeries are overwhelmed, resulting in extended waiting periods for appointments.

In light of these issues, I urge you to refuse this application due to its detrimental impact on both Green Belt purposes and our community’s infrastructure and character.

### Input Answers

**How long have you lived or worked in this area?**
Been a local resident for over 25 years

**Why does this land STRONGLY serve Green Belt purposes?**
This Green Belt stops Birchanger and Stansted becoming indistinguishable suburbs. The historic church would lose its rural setting. The gap to Bishop's Stortford is already minimal and would be eliminated. Strong Green Belt contribution.

**Why does this location FAIL the NPPF Para 155 sustainability test?**
There is no continuous footway to the station 2.1km away, making walking dangerous especially for children and elderly. The bus service is hourly at best, stops at 6:30pm, doesn't run Sundays. This fails basic sustainability tests.

**What "Golden Rules" promises are UNDELIVERABLE?**
Affordable housing viability is unproven at 50%. School expansion commitment is LAND not BUILDINGS - who pays construction costs? Highway contributions are vague and unfunded. BNG off-site creates delivery uncertainty. None of these promises are legally secured via enforceable Section 106.

**What infrastructure capacity problems have you observed?**
Healthcare crisis - my GP surgery has 3-week appointment waits. School capacity exhausted - Forest Hall full, no sixth form. Road network gridlocked every rush hour on B1383 and Cambridge Road. Flooding occurs regularly on local lanes.

I am writing to formally object to the proposed development on this Green Belt land.

Having been a resident of this community for over 25 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this area serves significant Green Belt purposes. This land effectively maintains a distinct separation between Birchanger and Stansted, ensuring they do not blend into indistinguishable suburbs. Additionally, the historic church in our village would be stripped of its rural setting, losing its heritage value. The already narrow buffer between our community and Bishop's Stortford would be completely eradicated by this proposal, undermining the strong contribution the Green Belt makes to preserving local character and openness.

The location is inherently unsuitable for development due to inadequate transport infrastructure. There is no continuous footway leading to the station, which is situated 2.1 kilometers away; hence, walking poses safety risks, particularly for children and the elderly. Public transport services are limited, with an infrequent bus service that ceases operation early in the evening and does not run on Sundays. This lack of viable sustainable transport options renders any claims of sustainability baseless.

Furthermore, there are serious concerns about local infrastructure capacity. Affordable housing viability at 50% has yet to be substantiated. The commitment to school expansion is limited to land provision without addressing who will bear construction costs. Highway contributions remain ambiguous and unfunded, while biodiversity net gain promises rely on off-site solutions lacking delivery certainty. Crucially, none of these commitments are underpinned by enforceable Section 106 agreements.

Finally, our existing healthcare facilities are overwhelmed; it currently takes three weeks to secure a GP appointment. Educational capacity is also exhausted—Forest Hall School is full with no sixth form provision available. Traffic congestion during rush hours severely impacts movement on key roads such as B1383 and Cambridge Road, exacerbated by frequent flooding along local lanes.

In light of these issues, I urge you to refuse this application due to its detrimental impact on our vital Green Belt and the unsustainable strain it would impose on local resources and infrastructure.
